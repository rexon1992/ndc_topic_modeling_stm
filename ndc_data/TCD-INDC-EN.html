<h2 id="Section_2_National_circumstances_37">Section 2. National circumstances</h2>
<p>Chad, a landlocked sub-Saharan country, lacking a coastline, covers a surface area of 1,284,000 km2, the majority of which is desert. The country’s main economic activities are those associated with the primary sector, such as subsistence agriculture, livestock rearing and fishing. Despite the oil industry being relative new, with exports only having started in 2004, it is already booming. An oil refinery, which opened in 2011, meets domestic demand for oil products.</p>

<p>Over the last ten years, Chad’s Saharan and Sahelian zones have spread 150 km south. This has resulted in reduced farming and pasture areas, which, in turn, has lead livestock rearers and farmers to move to more suitable areas to work, leading, in general, to a reinforcement of existing inequality and discrimination amongst certain populations. Likewise, Lake Chad has reduced in size from 25,000 km² in 1960 to 2,500 km² today. This reduction has considerably impacted upon crop and fish production, and forced inhabitants to move to wetter areas.</p>
<p>With the increase in oil exploitation, exporters of agro-pastoral products have lost ground to oil exporters, with oil representing 88% of exports in 2010, against 6% for livestock, 2% for cotton fibre and 4% for other products.</p>
<p>The state of the National Electricity Company’s (SNE), production facilities exclusively thermal, explains the high cost of electricity production, which represents an obstacle to the competitiveness in the Chadian economy, in particular in terms of industrial and commercial activity. The absence of an interconnected national grid makes economical pooling of the energy generated impossible, instead favouring the proliferation of isolated and onerous production facilities to supply the different cities across the country, which makes electricity expensive.</p>
<p>In line with its Government policy guidelines for development, Chad aspires to become an emerging country by 2030. In this regard, the Government intends, amongst other things, to reinforce environmental protection, GHG emissions mitigation measures and adaptation actions in respect of climate change.</p>
<p>The issue of environment protection is enshrined in articles 47 and 52 of the Constitution of Chad, and Act N°014/PR/1998 defines the general principles for protecting the environment. In 1992, Chad signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which was ratified on 30 April 1993. Since then, the country has produced the Initial and Second National Communications relating to climate change, in accordance with the relevant UNFCCC provisions. This demonstrates Chad’s desire to make an effective contribution to the global effort to combat global warming, to which the country is highly vulnerable given the fragility of its ecosystems and its economy, which is highly dependent on sectors that are sensitive to climate change.</p>
<p>In the face of development challenges, Chad is ready to fight against climate change and adapt to its impacts by making efforts to protect the environment, in particular through activities such as planting thousands of trees each year and implementing the national programme for the development of green belts around Chadian cities. In addition to these green belts, ten million trees are being planted as part of the African Great Green Wall initiative, and National Tree Week has been officially launched. Chad has also established a Special Fund for the Environment (FSE) in 2013, in order to mobilise its own resources through the establishment of specific taxes.</p>
<p>Under this INDC, Chad intends to reaffirm its determination to contribute to the global effort to reduce GHG emissions and reinforce its resilience to climate change, implementing coherent programmes which will enable it to become an emerging country by 2030, whilst favouring low-carbon development, as far as possible with the means available. The largest challenge to overcome is the move, between now and 2030, from a development model based on oil revenue, to a model based on a more diversified economy with sustainable utilisation of resources and an energy transition.</p>
<p>Chad supports the Lima summit’s call for action on climate change, as cited in the decision 1/CP.20, which called for each Party country to establish a nationally determined contribution in order to achieve the Convention’s objective. Chad’s contribution is based on measures and results.</p>
<h2 id="Section_3_Adaptation_70">Section 3. Adaptation</h2>
<h3 id="Impacts_and_vulnerability_71">Impacts and vulnerability</h3>
<p>The impacts of climate change are significant on the large hydrographic systems of the basins of Lakes Chad and Niger: natural, agro-silvo-pastoral, fishery and human systems. They include changes to the agricultural seasons, disturbances in the biological cycles of crops and a reduction in cereal crop production. Depending on the geographic zone, climate change exposes certain sectors and social groups to a medium to high level of vulnerability (1 = very high, 6 = lower), according to the NAPA and consultations carried out during the workshop launching the INDC preparation process.</p>

<h3 id="National_priorities_in_terms_of_adaptation_to_climate_change_89">National priorities in terms of adaptation to climate change</h3>
<p>Whilst the actions are applicable to all of Chad, it appears that the priority target zones (Kanem, Barh El Ghazal, Batha, Guéra, Hadjer Lamis, Wadi Fira; Ouaddai, Dar Sila, Lac, Moyen-Chari, Borkou, Tibesti, Ennedi Est, Ennedi Ouest) are especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change and, in part, to the arrival of displaced populations. There are approx. 700,000 displaced people in Chad, including refugees and Chadians returning from Sudan, the Central African Republic, Nigeria and Libya (OCHA, 2015).</p>
<ul><li>Cross-cutting priorities:
<ul>
<li>Reinforce the capacities of the stakeholders (farmers, fishermen and livestock rearers) and their revenue-generating activities;</li>
<li>Improve production techniques by developing water infrastructure, access to improved and adapted inputs(food crop and fodder seeds, animal gene banks, manure management, compost management, etc.), develop storage and conservation units to limit high post-harvest losses;</li>
<li>Inform, educate and communicate information relating to climate risk,(improve the observatory used to forecast meteorological events and develop the population’s ability to react in the event of a catastrophe);</li>
<li>Create an observatory for policies for adapting to climate change;</li>
<li>Improve the seasonal forecast of precipitation and surface runoff;</li>
<li>Manage climate risk</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Priorities by sector (NAPA, 2009 and June 2015 Workshop):
<ul>
<li><strong>Water:</strong> manage water through the creation and development of agricultural irrigation structures including retention ponds, irrigated perimeters, artificial lakes, and the application of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) and Water Governance</li>
<li>Agriculture: develop intensive and diverse cultivation, using improved inputs, (organic fertilisers including composts, adapted plant varieties), agroforestry, land and water conservation, (implementation of soil restoration works) and preparation and distribution of new cropping calendars</li>
<li><strong>Livestock:</strong> securing pastoralism and transhumance through common grazing zones, as well as creating and popularising fodder banks and crossbreeding of animal species -</li>
<li><strong>Fish:</strong> development of enclosed fish farming areas</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The cost of national priorities, in terms of adaptation to climate change, are met on the one hand by the National Investment Plan for the Rural Sector (PNISR), covering the period 2014 – 2020 and validated in 2014, and on the other by the meeting held by the Food Crisis Prevention Network (RPCA) in March 2015, which put forward the Country Resilience Priorities (PRP) AGIR CHAD for implementation by 2020, which would help approx. 6.5 million people escape food and nutritional insecurity</p>
<p>The PNISR, using an initial amount of 2,301.7 billion CFA francs for the period 2014-2020, estimate that, by 2030, by applying an annual population growth rate of 3.6% and an annual inflation rate of 2.9% <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>, this amount will be 4,321 billion CFA francs. The overall cost of the AGIR CHAD PRP will be 775 billion CFA francs for a period of 5 years until 2020. By 2030, the total necessary funding to implement the INDC adaptation component would be 14.170 billion USD, in order to establish development resilient to climate change.</p>
<h3 id="Current_and_planned_initiatives_to_support_adaptation_112">Current and planned initiatives to support adaptation</h3>
<p>On the national level, the initiatives to support adaptation have just started within the National Adaptation Programme of Action for Climate Change (NAPA adopted in2009), in particular with financing by the EU (~5.26 billion CFA francs or 8 million Euros through the AMCC –Global Climate Change Alliance project-) for the following priority projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Development of intensive and diversified crops that are adapted to extreme climate risks</li>
<li>Soil restoration and defence against degradation caused by climate change</li>
<li>Improvement of intercommunity grassland areas, in order to reduce migratory movements due to climate change</li>
<li>National Agency for the Great Green Wall</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these, adaptation will be supported by the 11th European Development Fund for the period 2014-2020. This foresees the provision of 297 million euros for “rural development, nutrition and food safety”, and an amount of 53 million euros for “sustainable management of natural resources”.</p>
<p>Finally, adaptation is supported by the Project to Improve the Resilience of Agricultural Systems in Chad (PARSAT). The PARSAT with total funding of 36.2 million USD, co-funded by IFAD, GEF, ASAP and the Chadian government was put in place in 2015, for a period of 7 years.</p>
<p>At a regional level, there are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Lake Chad basin sustainable development programme (PRODEBALT with funding from ADB)</li>
<li>The nutrition and food insecurity resilience reinforcement programme in the Sahel (P2RS, based on African Development Funds amounting to 15 million USD)</li>
<li>The Project in Support of the Lake Chad Basin initiative to reduce vulnerability and the risks associated with STIs/HIV/AIDS (PAIBLT, ADB)</li>
<li>The regional “Adaptation to climate change in the Lake Chad Basin” project (German Ministry for Economic Development and Cooperation/Federal Enterprise for International Cooperation cooperation) covering the period 2013-2018</li>
<li>The Lake Chad preservation project: contribution to the Lake development strategy (GEF-ADF)</li>
<li>Pan-African Great Green Wall agency</li>
<li>The Programme for integrated management of cross-border basins in African – example: Lake Chad (EU)</li>
<li>The regional programme to reinforce the resilience of countries in the Sahel (26 million US, IDB)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Gaps_and_barriers_132">Gaps and barriers</h3>
<p><strong>Gaps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Poor understanding of the concept of climate change by the vast majority of society</li>

<h3 id="Assumptions_and_methodology_205">Assumptions and methodology</h3>
<h4 id="Methodology_206">Methodology</h4>
<p>The accounting method for GHG inventory in each sector is the same as that used in the IPCC 2006 Guidelines on national GHG inventories. The values used, with regards to the Global Warming Potential (GWP) for the different greenhouse gases, are those published in Appendix 3 of Decision 24, adopted by the Conference of the Parties during their 19th meeting between the 11th and 23rd November 2013. Energy demand projections for 2030 are based on the Blueprint for Chad’s energy sector. For the waste sector, the projections reflect the demographic and migratory forecasts published by the National Institute of Statistics for Economic and Demographic Studies (INSEED). In the calculations of GHG gases for the agriculture, livestock, land use and forestry sectors, in the absence of national data, the values published by the statistical division of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAOSTAT) are used. The reference scenario was built considering the assumptions cited in the vision and strategy documents in place in Chad, in particular: </p>
<ul>
<li>“Vision 2030, The Chad we want”</li>
<li>ECCAS 2025 strategic vision on the environment</li>
<li>ECCAS General Environment and Natural Resources Management Policy</li>
<li>Order No. 89 PR/PM/MAE/SG/DGE/2015 relating to the establishment of a Core Working Group (GTR) responsible for preparing Chad for the COP 21</li>
<li>Chad Energy Sector Blueprint</li>
<li>Five-year Agricultural Development Plan for Chad (2013-2018)</li>
<li>National Development Plan 2013-2015</li>
<li>National Livestock Development Plan (2009-2016)</li>
<li>Food Security Profile</li>
<li>National Poverty Reduction Strategy document</li>
<li>The Niamey declaration on Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) for the agricultural, livestock and forestry sectors in April 2015</li>
<li>Project to Improve the Resilience of Agricultural Systems in Chad (PARSAT), launched in 2015</li>
<li>Regional Programme for the Promotion of Household and Alternative Energies in the Sahel (PREDAS)</li>
<li>National Food and Nutrition Policies 2014-2025</li></ul>
<h4 id="Carbon_offsets_222">Carbon offsets</h4>
<p>As a Non-Annex I Party of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and Least Developed Countries (LDC), the Republic of Chad does not intend to appeal to the international carbon markets in order to compensate for its own emissions. The country hopes, by contrast, to encourage investment in mitigation projects on its own territory, notably by means of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and the REDD+ programme. These initiatives must particularly focus on sharing benefits with the local population, for example in terms of: (i) access to sustainable energy for all (ii) generation of local jobs, (iii) reducing impact on health and on the environment, (iv) reducing inequalities, including gender-based inequality and (v) respecting human rights.</p>
<h4 id="Accounting__verification_system_224">Accounting / verification system</h4>
<p>The monitoring and assessment system will entail quantifying GHG emissions on a national level, as well as their evolution over time, with the aim of periodically providing robust data reflecting the country’s progress with regards to mitigation and sustainable development. A measurement, reporting and verification system (MRV) must be drawn up, with the aim of being precise but also simple. In order to reduce inherent institutional, technical, political and financial risks, it will be necessary to reinforce technical capacity, as well as research and stakeholder coordination, in order to carry out this activity. Chad encourages the Parties cited in Annex I of the Convention to technically and financially support the establishment of follow-up and assessment initiatives in Chad.</p>
<h4 id="Institutional_arrangements_for_implementation_226">Institutional arrangements for implementation</h4>
<p>Implementing mitigation actions and reaching the GHG emission limitation objectives set out in Chad’s INDC include aspects which are conditional on the availability of international support in terms of funding, technology transfer and reinforcement of capacity. To prepare and implement mitigation projects, the country intends to request international aid from different available sources, in particular from agencies for development assistance, bilateral and multilateral financial institutions, UNFCCC financial mechanisms (Green Fund for the climate, adaptation funds, GEF etc.) and the private sector. Funding needs have been estimated at approx. 21.233 billion US$. Implementation of Chad’s INDC will place particular emphasis on better taking account of human rights and equality between the sexes.</p>
<h4 id="Ambitious_and_fair_nature_of_the_intended_contribution_228">Ambitious and fair nature of the intended contribution</h4>
<p>Limiting the growth of GHG emissions represents, in itself, a great challenge for Chad, considering national circumstances. In economic terms, Chad is classed amongst the Least Developed Countries (LDC), having a GDP per inhabitant of 676 USD.</p>
<p>Chad suffers significant structural vulnerabilities, due in particular to the country’s isolation and its exposure to natural and climatic hazards. According to statistics from the United Nations, Chad has an Economic Vulnerability Index of 52.8, compared to an average of 45.7 in 2012 among all of least developed countries. In the face of these developmental challenges, the contribution from the Republic of Chad is ambitious, as it establishes an allowance of 2314.66 GgCO<sub>2</sub>e, on average, per year for 15 years, for the unconditional scenario. This objective will be achieved by various means, including increasing the renewable electricity supply from 0 to 750 GWh/year in 15 years, i.e. to a level equivalent to double the current total national production for all sectors included and introducing/reinforcing sustainable practices in the waste management, agriculture, livestock, land use and forestry sectors.</p>
<p>The established contribution is also fair as GHG emissions per inhabitant in Chad are around 0.732 tCO<sub>2</sub>e, placing them amongst the lowest in the world. In line with the unconditional objective, emissions per inhabitant in 2030 will be 1.028 tCO<sub>2</sub>e, whereas they would be just 0.364 tCO<sub>2</sub>e if means are acquired to enable the country to reach the conditional objective of a 71% reduction.</p>
<p>Chad intends to achieve this established contribution whilst pursuing its development objectives and using its available resources in a sustainable manner.</p>

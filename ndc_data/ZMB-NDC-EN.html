<h2><a id="ZAMBIAS_INTENDED_NATIONALLY_DETERMINED_CONTRIBUTION_INDC_TO_THE_2015_AGREEMENT_ON_CLIMATE_CHANGE_0"></a>ZAMBIA’S INTENDED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION (INDC) TO THE 2015 AGREEMENT ON CLIMATE CHANGE</h2>
<h3><a id="1INTRODUCTION_2"></a>1.INTRODUCTION</h3>
<h4><a id="11_Background_4"></a>1.1 Background</h4>
<p>This document presents Zambia’s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) to the 2015 Agreement on climate change in response to decisions adopted at the 19th and 20th sessions of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).</p>
<p>Zambia’s INDC includes both mitigation and adaptation components based on her national circumstances and is in line with decisions 1/CP.19 and 1/CP.20. The successful implementation of Zambia’s INDC will result in an estimated total emission reduction of 38,000GgCO<sub>2</sub>eq which translates to 47% (internationally supported efforts) against 2010 as a base year. This emission reduction is conditional and subject to the availability of international support in form of finance, technology and capacity building. The total budget for implementing both components is estimated at US$ 50 billion by the year 2030, out of this USD 35 billion is expected to come from external sources while $15 billion will be mobilized from domestic sources.</p>
<h4><a id="12_National_Circumstances_10"></a>1.2 National Circumstances</h4>
<p>Climate variability and change has become a major threat to sustainable development in Zambia. The country is already experiencing climate induced hazards which include drought and dry spells, seasonal and flash floods and extreme temperatures. Some of these hazards, especially the droughts and floods have increased in frequency and intensity over the past few decades and have adversely impacted food and water security, water quality, energy and livelihoods of the people, especially in rural communities.</p>
<p>Recent climate trends based on records from 1960 to 2003 indicate that mean annual temperature has increased by 1.3oC, since 1960, an average rate of 0.34oC per decade. On the other hand, the mean rainfall over Zambia has decreased by an average rate of 1.9 mm/month (2.3%) per decade since 1960. The future trends in the country are towards a higher average temperature, a possible decrease in total rainfall, and some indication of heavy events of rainfall. An assessment of potential climate impacts shows that they will seriously undermine the efforts to improve the livelihoods of Zambians if left unaddressed <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>. The assessment <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> further analyzed the negative impacts of climate change on key economic sectors including water, agriculture, forestry, wildlife, tourism, mining, energy, infrastructure and health. Further studies have estimated GDP loss over a 10-20 year mid-term planning horizon for agriculture productivity and its associated effects on poverty levels<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>, the potential impact of an energy crisis, the higher cost of treating climate related diseases such as malaria and malnutrition, and the loss of natural resources which provide critical ecosystem services to urban, peri-urban and rural communities <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The aggregated estimated total GDP loss by sector was in the range of USD 4,330-5,440 million with the following sector GDP losses: Agriculture (2,200 - 3,130), Energy related (270 - 450), Health (460), and Natural Resources (1,400). In view of these challenges, Zambia has in the recent past developed various climate change-related policies, strategies, projects and programs in response to climate change impacts. These include: the National Policy on Environment (NPE, 2007); the National Climate Change Response Strategy (NCCRS, 2010); National Forestry Policy of 2014; National Energy Policy of 2008, The National Agriculture Policy of 2014 and Transport Policy of 2002; National Strategy for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+, 2015); Second National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP2); the National Adaptation Plan of Action on Climate Change (NAPA, 2007); Technology Needs Assessment (TNA, 2013); Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs, 2014); Second National Communication (SNC, 2015).</p>
<p>These policies, strategies, programmes and projects are aligned with the Revised Sixth National Development Plan (RSDNP) and the Vision 2030 which promotes “A prosperous middle income country by 2030”, both of which support development of a low carbon and climate-resilient development pathway. In addition, Government ratified the Kyoto Protocol in 2006 among other things to facilitate implementation of the Clean Development Mechanism. The country is also in the process of developing its National Adaptation Plan (NAP) for long term adaptation planning and mainstreaming of climate change into national development planning process. The development of the Seventh National Development Plan (SeNDP, 2017-2021) is also underway which will take into account climate change issues</p>
<p>An assessment undertaken as part of the INDC preparation for the mitigation component revealed that mitigation policies/actions/programs converge into three programs which have mitigation and adaptation effects: Sustainable Forest Management, Sustainable Agriculture and Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency.</p>
<p>Similarly, adaptation measures identified based on vulnerability assessment of seven key economic sectors (agriculture, water, forestry, energy, wildlife, infrastructure and health) comprise three goals/programs that have strong synergies with mitigation. These are: Adaptation of strategic productive systems (agriculture, forests, wildlife and water); Adaptation of strategic infrastructure and health systems; and Enhanced capacity building, research, technology transfer and finance.</p>
<h3><a id="2MITIGATION_31"></a>2.MITIGATION</h3>
<h4><a id="21__Contribution_33"></a>2.1 Contribution</h4>
<p>Zambia intends to reduce its CO<sub>2</sub>eq emissions by implementing three (3) programs driven by the country’s Climate Response Strategy and supported by national development policies including energy, forestry, agriculture, water, Town and Country Planning, sanitation, and transport. Further, these programs have been developed based on Zambia’s plans and actions and supported by various climate-related activities such as REDD+, NAMAs and Technology Needs Assessment (TNA), among others (Table 1).</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1</strong>: Extent and magnitude of contribution of Zambia’s GHG reduction with scenarios for limited and substantial international support</p>
<p>Implementation of the domestic efforts with substantial international support is conditional upon strong commitment of international climate, bilateral and multilateral finance in addition to provision of domestic resources. It is expected from this scenario that by the end of 2030, estimated 38,000 Gg CO<sub>2</sub>eq could be mitigated, compared to 20,000 Gg CO<sub>2</sub>eq under the domestic efforts with limited international support. This translates into a reduction potential of 25% and 47% against 2010 as the base year for the domestic efforts with limited international support and domestic efforts with substantial international support respectively. .</p>

<h3><a id="3ADAPTATION_75"></a>3.ADAPTATION</h3>
<h4><a id="31_Adaptation_measures_77"></a>3.1 Adaptation measures</h4>
<p>As a minimal contributor to global GHG emissions, Zambia places significant importance and priority on adaptation to the effects of climate change in order to enhance the resilience of its population, ecosystems, infrastructure, productive and health systems. The key socio-economic sectors identified as most vulnerable to climate change impacts include: agriculture, water, forestry, energy, wildlife, infrastructure and health. All the adaptation actions have strong synergies with mitigation actions.</p>
<p>Zambia’s capacity to undertake and sustain strong mitigation actions is dependent upon support for the implementation of the cross-cutting adaptation actions described herein.</p>
<p>The intended contribution on adaptation stated here is for the purposes of information so that an overview of the range of planned climate-related actions of the country is made known; it does not constitute an international obligation to the country. The extent of implementation of the intended contribution is contingent upon the financial resources, capacity and technologies available to the country through both domestic and international support to stimulate investments and innovation.</p>
<h4><a id="32_Approach_for_Adaptation_Measures_85"></a>3.2 Approach for Adaptation Measures</h4>
<p>The adaptation measures are applicable to the following sectors: Agriculture; Water; Forestry; Energy; Wildlife; Infrastructure; and Health. These have been identified in the NAPA (2007) and subsequent assessments as the most vulnerable sectors to impacts of climate change especially droughts and floods.</p>
<p>In terms of implementation, Zambia will take a landscape approach at watershed level to enhance synergies between adaptation and mitigation actions. Zambia has six major watersheds: Tanganyika; Luapula; Chambeshi; Luangwa; Kafue; and Zambezi</p>
<h4><a id="33_Impacts_and_Vulnerability_91"></a>3.3 Impacts and Vulnerability</h4>
<p>Zambia’s geographic characteristics coupled with high poverty levels (currently estimated at 60%) <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup> and limited institutional capacity for adaptation, make it a highly vulnerable country to the adverse impacts of climate change especially droughts and floods</p>
<h4><a id="34_Planned_Actions_95"></a>3.4 Planned Actions</h4>
<p>The adaptation measures comprise three (3) goals/programs and 11 priority actions (Table 4):</p>

<h3><a id="4PLANNING_PROCESS_124"></a>4.PLANNING PROCESS</h3>
<p>The mitigation and adaptation programmes elaborated in this INDC will be integrated in the Seventh National Development Plan (SeNDP) currently being developed. Planning for adaptation and mitigation programs under the Zambia’s INDC will be integrated in existing planning processes and supported by national budget allocations to sectors, ministries and sub-national authorities towards implementation of both the domestic and international supported efforts.</p>
<p>In addition, the decentralisation process currently being undertaken in the country will enhance multi stakeholder participation in the implementation of the INDC.</p>
<p>The planning process also recognizes the efforts being made to establish the National Climate Change Development Council for climate change coordination in the country as stipulated in the draft National Policy on Climate Change. Furthermore, the National Adaptation Planning process being undertaken by Government provides a good basis for long term adaptation programming and mainstreaming of climate change adaptation into the existing national planning processes.</p>
<p>The National Designated Authority (NDA) for the Green Climate Fund has already been designated and is expected to play a key role of “clearing house or entity” for climate change projects to be funded from GCF in Zambia. The process is on-going to select a National Implementing Entity (NIE) and establishing a National Climate Change Fund (NCCF).</p>
<p>The effectiveness of the INDC implementation will be ensured through development and strengthening of existing Monitoring Reporting and Verification (MRV) systems to track progress of implementation of both the mitigation and adaptation programs.</p>
<h3><a id="5MEANS_OF_IMPLEMENTATION_TIMEFRAME_AND_MONITORING_136"></a>5.MEANS OF IMPLEMENTATION, TIMEFRAME AND MONITORING</h3>
<h4><a id="51_Means_of_Implementation_138"></a>5.1 Means of Implementation</h4>
<p>Zambia’s contribution will be implemented with both domestic and international support. It is estimated that over USD 50 billion is required for both mitigation (USD 35 billion for Domestic efforts with substantial International support) and adaptation (USD 20 billion) actions across the programs up to 2030. Of this, USD 15 billion will be unconditional support provided by the Zambian Government and USD 35 billion will be conditional support to be sourced externally. Zambia will require international support in form of finance, investment, technology development and transfer, and capacity-building to fully realize its intended contribution. Further analysis will be necessary to refine the required investment cost and determine the domestic support as more data and results of studies become available. During implementation of these programs, Government will engage all relevant stakeholders to achieve the emission reduction target as part of the country’s contribution to attainment of 2 degree goal.</p>
<h3><a id="52_Monitoring_and_Evaluation_142"></a>5.2 Monitoring and Evaluation</h3>
<p>Since the INDC is a part of the national development and planning process for climate change issues, it will be monitored and evaluated according to the existing monitoring and evaluation frameworks. Further, this will be done in a wide consultative and participatory manner. In addition, since INDC is a planning tool, it will be reviewed and updated as part of the national planning process.</p>
<h3><a id="53_Fairness_and_Ambition_146"></a>5.3 Fairness and Ambition</h3>
<p>Zambia considers her INDC fair and ambitious enough to contribute to low carbon and climate resilient economy by 2030 in accordance with its special national circumstance and desire to become a high middle income and prosperous Nation by 2030. Zambia is low contributor to the global greenhouse gas emission. In developing the INDC, Zambia considered the general principles and provisions of the Convention especially those related to Common But Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR) and equitable access to atmospheric space.</p>
<p>In light of above, Zambia will endeavor to make significant emission reduction through implementation of this ambitious INDC and provide leadership in the region through a set target of 47% emission reduction target, with 2010 being the base year. The country’s INDC is guided by the country’s desire to reduce poverty, attainment low carbon climate resilient economy, sustainable development and become a high middle income and prosperous nation by 2030 in line with its Revised Sixth National Development Plan and the country’s Vision 2030.</p>
<p>The successful implementation of Zambia’s INDC is conditional and dependent on the level of support to be provided through the Convention and other multilateral and bilateral arrangements. However, the country is committed to meeting its obligations under the Convention by implementing ambitious mitigation and adaptation programmes across the prioritized sectors. This will support the well-being of the citizens and contribute to the attainment of the objective of the Convention once adequate support is provided. This is what constitutes fairness and ambition for Zambia’s INDC.</p>

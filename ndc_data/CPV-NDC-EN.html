<h2><a id="INTENDED_NATIONALLY_DETERMINED_CONTRIBUTION_OF_CABO_VERDE_0"></a>INTENDED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION OF CABO VERDE</h2>
<p>The “Intended Nationally Determined Contribution” (INDC) of Cabo Verde is hereby submitted jointly by the Ministry of Environmental, Housing and Land Planning and by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with a view to contribute to the process of the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to be held in Paris in December 2015.</p>
<p>It responds to COP decisions 1/CP.19 and 1/CP.20 inviting all Parties to communicate to the secretariat their INDCs so as to achieve the objective set out in Article 2 of the UNFCCC and in a way that demonstrates a progression beyond their current undertakings. The submission draws attention to the fact that Cabo Verde is a small island developing state (SIDS) and that the strategies, plans and actions for low greenhouse gas emission (GHG) development put forward herein reflect the special circumstances and adaptation challenges of Cabo Verde, which require specific international support in terms of capacity-building, technology transfer, and financial commitments.</p>
<p>The preparation of this document was coordinated by the National Directorate of Environment and is structured as follows: (i) summary of contributions; (ii) national context and overall vision; (iii) mitigation; and (iv) adaptation.</p>
<p>Cabo Verde´s mitigation contributions listed herein are expressed in the form of Renewable Energy (RE) and Energy Efficiency (EE) Targets and other Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs). RE and EE Targets are proposed for both 2025 and 2030, along with biennial monitoring of progress based on pre-defined indicators and supported by GHG inventories.</p>
<p>Where expressly indicated, the mitigation contributions and adaptation measures proposed are unconditional unilateral efforts. All other contributions proposed are conditional upon receipt of adequate, timely and predictable international support. Cabo Verde supports the use of market-based mechanisms to implement and achieve the conditional portion of the contributions mentioned in this document.</p>
<p>Finally, Cabo Verde will update, as appropriate, its INDC to account for the most recent GHG inventory currently being prepared as part of Cabo Verde´s Third National Communication process, expected to be concluded in the second half of 2016.</p>
<p>This INDC demonstrates Cabo Verde´s continued commitment to sustainable, low- carbon and climate resilient policies and the country´s contribution to global efforts to reduce emissions and limit the increase in global average temperatures to 2°C or 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.</p>

<h3><a id="I_Summary_of_contributions_19"></a>I. Summary of contributions</h3>
<p>In order to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding, this first section presents a summary of Cabo Verde’s intended mitigation and adaptation contributions.</p>
<p>Cabo Verde strongly believes that, in light of its national circumstances, in particular its position as an arid small island developing states (SIDS) particularly vulnerable to climate change, its INDC is fair, ambitious, and represents a genuine contribution towards achieving the objective of the Convention as set out in its Article 2.</p>

<p>Cabo Verde’s planning process is anchored on a wide participatory and societal approach and has been shaped by a core set of programmatic documents, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cabo Verde´s Transformational Agenda for 2030;</li>
<li>National Energy Efficiency Plan of 2015 (PNAEE);</li>
<li>Ntional Renewable Energy Plan of 2015 (PNAER);</li>

<li>Cabo Verde´s Low Carbon and Climate Resilient Development Strategy (in preparation).</li>
</ul>
<p>Cabo Verde is committed to implement the Sustainable Energy for All (SE4all) agenda and - as host to the ECOWAS Regional Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (ECREEE) - intends to assume regional leadership on energy transformation in Africa.</p>
<p>Cabo Verde has recently signed together with the European Union, Luxembourg, Spain, Portugal and Austria a Joint Declaration on Reinforced Cooperation in the Field of Sustainable Energy. The cooperation will support Cabo Verde on its pathway to universal energy access and enhanced electricity supply from 100% renewable energy sources.</p>
<p>Cabo Verde’s national efforts and ambitions respond to the process of the Durban Platform as well as to the Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of SIDS, the Samoa Pathway, and the Post- 2015 Development Agenda.</p></td></tr>

<p>Cabo Verde makes an unconditional commitment:</p>
<ul>
<li>to achieve 100% grid access by 2017;</li>
<li>and to achieve a 30% renewable energy penetration rate into the electric grid by 2025.</li>
</ul>
<p>With international support, Cabo Verde seeks to increase the renewable energy uptake in electricity to 100% by 2025, with best efforts to achieve this goal already by 2020, in accordance with the following indicative trajectory:</p>
<ul>
<li>35% RE penetration rate in 2016-2018;</li>
<li>50% RE penetration rate in 2018-2020;</li>
<li>100% RE penetration rate in 2020-2025.</li>
</ul>
<p>To achieve this goal, the following key measures are envisaged:</p>
<ul>
<li>smart-grid enhancement for the country’s 9 independent networks with state-of-the-art power conditioning, production and distribution control;</li>
<li>built-up of energy storage facilities (including through batteries and flywheels);</li>
<li>design of renewable micro-grids;</li>
<li>design of individual energy systems (solar home systems); and</li>
<li>systematic deployment of solar-water-heaters across all islands.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ambitious renewable energy roadmap will require close planning in public-private partnerships, simplified procedures for licensing and certification (“one-stop- shops”) and the creation of robust competitive market conditions and the consideration of specific fiscal incentives to attract the private sector.</p>
<p>To reach the above indicative targets, investments in the order of 310 million EUR (50% RE penetration) and 1 billion EUR (100% RE penetration) will be needed.</p>
<p>Cabo Verde estimates that the renewable energy target will generate annual GHG emission reductions in the range of 600-700 tCO<sub>2</sub>eq.</p>

<h3><a id="II__National_Context_and_Overall_Vision_215"></a>II. National Context and Overall Vision</h3>
<p>Cabo Verde is made up of ten islands and eight islets, located in the Atlantic Ocean, some 450 km west of Senegal. It has a land area of 4,033 square kilometres and a 700,000 square kilometres Economic Exclusivity Zone. The 10 islands are grouped into Windward islands (northern islands group) comprising Santo Antão, São Vicente, São Nicolau, Santa Luzia, Sal, Boa Vista, and Leeward islands (southern islands group) consisting of Maio, Santiago, Fogo and Brava. Cabo Verde has an estimated population of 524.832 inhabitants in 2015.</p>
<p>While the country’s contribution to global warming has been negligible, as a small island country and a dry Sahelian country with only 10% arable land area, Cabo Verde is particularly vulnerable to climate change and its impacts, ranging from extreme weather conditions to sea-level rise and the degradation of fish stocks. Changes in seasonal, weather and rain patterns are already showing. Along with a depletion of the country’s scarce natural resources, climate variability in Cabo Verde will increase leading to more storms, floods and droughts, and an ever-shorter rainy season. With 80% of total population live in coastal areas, Cabo Verde is particularly sensitive to sea- level rise and coastal hazards.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges, Cabo Verde is an emerging nation with a strong and transformative development agenda. Since achieving independence in 1975, Cabo Verde has evolved into a stable democracy and continuously growing economy, leading to substantial increases in per capita income, widespread education and health, and life- expectancy, graduating in 2007 from the list of least developed countries. Cabo Verde’s human development index (HDI) grew by 11% between 2000 and 2013 and stood, in 2014, at 0,636.</p>
<p>Today’s economy is mainly shaped by the tertiary sector (almost 70% of GDP), with the tourism industry already representing about 30% of GDP. The industry expects robust growth rates, from half a million tourists in 2013 to one million tourists per year by 2020. While a welcome boost to the economy, this development will increase the pressure on the country’s fragile ecosystem and resources.</p>
<p>Cabo Verde is firmly committed to a global low-carbon transformation, which decouples economic growth from emissions, provides for the sustainable use of natural resources, limits average global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, with the ultimate goal of achieving 1.5 degree Celsius in the long-term, and assists nations with adapting to the consequences from sea-level rise, extreme weather events, and other effects of a changing climate.</p>
<p>At the domestic level, Cabo Verde has laid the relevant groundwork to achieve energy- independence on 100% renewable sources, integrate highest levels of water-efficiency and resilience to climate change, operate a fully sustainable economy and a sustainable tourism infrastructure, and work towards building what Cabo Verde has always carried in its name: a truly green island state.</p>

<h4><a id="Energy_Sector_241"></a>Energy Sector</h4>
<p>By 2010, the total annual energy use stood at 1,686,2 GWh. Road transport, aviation and shipping (between islands) stood for most of energy demand, followed by the residential, business and tourism sector, industries, and water production (see Figure 1).</p>
<p><img src="CPV-1.png" alt="Energy consumption per energy subsector in 2010" height="400"></p>
<p><strong>Figure 1</strong> - Energy consumption per energy subsector in 2010</p>
<p>The entire sector is heavily reliant on imported fossil fuels (petroleum, diesel, gasoline, gas butane, and gasoil) and, in the year 2000, corresponded to around 92.9% of the CO<sub>2</sub>e emissions in the country.</p>
<p>However, Cabo Verde is beginning to gradually increase the proportion of wind and solar energy in the energy mix, moving from 1.2% of electricity production from renewable energy n 2010 to about 25% (representing 35 MW capacity) today. Cabo Verde supports and works closely with the Sustainable Energy for All (SE4all) Initiative and - as host to the ECOWAS Regional Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (ECREEE) - assumes regional leadership on energy transformation in Africa.</p>
<p>According to Cabo Verde´s National Energy Efficiency Plan (PNAEE), today’s primary energy consumption will grow by about 2% until 2020 and then increase to 3% per year from 2020 to 2030 (“Base Scenario”). The overall energy demand in 2030 is estimated to be around 2,700 GWh (see Figure 2).</p>
<p><img src="CPV-2.png" alt="Estimates of final energy demand under the base scenario" height="400"><br>
<strong>Figure 2</strong> - Estimates of final energy demand under the Base Scenario</p>
<p>We attempt to depart from the Base Scenario and its GHG emissions profile by transforming the electricity sector to rely on 100% renewable sources until 2025 and by reducing overall consumption by 20% until 2030.</p>
<h5><a id="Proposed_measures_259"></a>Proposed measures</h5>
<p>Within the context of the domestic structural reforms planned under Cabo Verde’s Transformational Agenda, the country aims to achieve a fully decarbonized electricity system by 2030, while meeting increased demand (see Figure 3) at affordable prices.</p>

<p>Cabo Verde unconditionally commits to achieving a electric power penetration rate of 30% by 2025. Provided the necessary international technical and financial support is made available (in adequate, timely and predictable manner), Cabo Verde will increase the penetration rate to 100% of the installed electric power from renewables sources by 2025, with best efforts to achieve this indicative goal already by 2020. The indicative implementation trajectory is (i) 35% RE penetration rate in 2016-2018; (ii) 50% RE penetration rate in 2018-2020; and (iii) 100% RE penetration rate in 2020-2025.</p>
<p>Renewable sources will be based mostly on mature technologies, in particular, wind and solar, without however ignoring the potential for geothermal energy and biodiesel in specific areas.</p>
<p>In addition, Cabo Verde unconditionally commits to achieving long-term energy efficiency gains in the order of 10% in relation to the Base Scenario by 2030. Conditional on international technical and financial support, Cabo Verde will reduce overall energy demand by 20% in relation to the Base Scenario by 2030, with best efforts to achieve this indicative reduction effort already by 2025.</p>
<p>With respect to the goal to achieve the 10% reduction and 20% reduction, respectively, in overall energy demand by 2030, Cabo Verde intends to adopt a number of energy efficiency measures in several sub-sectors, including buildings, appliances, large energy consumers, fuel use and at household level.</p>

<strong>Figure 4</strong>: Energy efficiency target for 2030 (red) compared to the base scenario (blue)</p>
<p>The high ambition of Cabo Verde’s goals on renewable energy and energy efficiency will require a technology overhaul of the country’s energy system, paired with an enabling regulatory environment (including the consideration of specific fiscal incentives) that is able to attract sufficient private sector interest. Energy grid and storage capacity will also have to be expanded considerably and different storage technologies will be applied in light of the particularities of each island. Table 3 below indicates the goals and actions proposed by Cabo Verde in the energy sector. Monitoring and reporting of Cabo Verde´s performance will be done via Biennial Update Reports (BURs) and, in the case of proposed NAMAs, according to the NAMA´s own MRV mechanism.</p>

<h4><a id="Forest_Sector_303"></a>Forest Sector</h4>
<p>One of Cabo Verde’s highest economic, environmental and climate change related priorities concerns the country’s forests. Forest vegetation and forest soils prove the most effective means to store and retain water, minerals and nutrients. They avoid erosion, soil degradation and desertification, thus securing agricultural land. They provide biomass sources; and increase resilience against long, increasingly often, periods of drought. Water availability is approximately 500 m3 a year per person, the second lowest of any country in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>After centuries of degradation, Cabo Verde has successfully engaged in reforestation and afforestation campaigns since the 1920s. Today’s forested area spans some 84,000 hectares, roughly a fifth of the national land territory, the vast majority of it planted (with about 400 trees per hectare). Despite considerable planting activities, management tools such as inventories and management plans remain at an infancy state.</p>
<p>Degradation, too, continues. About 35% of households - virtually all of them located in rural areas - depend on firewood for cooking food. Most of the wood biomass - according to estimates some 100 tonnes a year - originate from forested lands and is harvested with scarce regard to sustainable harvesting methods. Pressure from a growing population, unplanned urbanization, and non-sustainable grazing contribute to overall degradation. Together with a notable increase in drought years since the 1960s, this represents the most single threat to sustainable development in Cabo Verde.</p>
<p>The leading policy framework for Cabo Verde’s forestry sector includes the Economic Transformation Strategy (TEE), which proposes, among others, the sustainable management of resources and the development of agroforestry and the participatory management of forest areas, as well as the Strategy Document on Growth and Poverty Reduction (Documento de Estratégia de Crescimento e Redução da Pobreza - “DECRP”) III - covering the years 2011-2016 - which argues for a “better management of natural resources, including lands, water, fishing and floral resources” and for “economic, social and physical resilience towards natural disasters and climate change related incidents to alleviate the associated risks” and the National Forestry Action Plan (NFAP).</p>
<h5><a id="Proposed_measures_312"></a>Proposed measures</h5>
<p>Table 4 below shows the goals and actions proposed by Cabo Verde in the forestry sector. Monitoring and reporting of Cabo Verde´s performance will be done via Biennial Update Reports (BURs) and, where appropriate, make use of CDM (and other widely applied) baseline and monitoring methodologies.</p>

<h4><a id="Waste_Management_Sector_324"></a>Waste Management Sector</h4>
<p>There are few comprehensive surveys on waste, waste management, and emissions from waste. Main sources of wastewater and solid waste emissions are household waste, tourism induced, and agricultural waste. According to the Second National Communication, emissions from the waste sector accounted for 32.4% of total CH<sub>4</sub> emissions in 2000, and solid waste disposal corresponded to 97.0% of that portion. Cabo Verde solid waste management has traditionally been organized around its 22 municipalities with most of the solid waste - around 113,000 tonnes per year in 2010 - still going directly into open dumps, with the exception of the city of Praia which currently operates a sanitary landfill. In addition, while there is potential for capturing energy in wastewater treatment plants, the use of sludge for thermal power generation purposes remains at concept stage.</p>
<p>Cabo Verde initiated an ambitious governance reform process to overcome the deficiencies in the sanitation sector. The 2010 the National Basic Sanitation Plan is currently being updated through the Waste Roadmap for Cabo Verde (Roadmap de Resíduos de Cabo Verde). It also launched the National Strategic Water and Sanitation Plan (Plano Estratégico Nacional de Água e Saneamento - “PLENAS”) and is currently preparing detailed water and sanitation master plans (Planos Diretores de Água e Saneamento - PDAS) for each of the islands. The reformed Water and Sanitation Code (Código de Água e Saneamento) and the General Solid Waste Law are expected to be soon enacted.</p>

<h3><a id="IV__Adaptation_340"></a>IV. Adaptation</h3>
<p>Due to its small insular and volcanic characteristics, Cabo Verde suffers from severe natural resources constraints. The lack of arable lands (only about 10% of the land is potentially arable) forces the country to import between 80% and 90% of its food needs. In addition, the country´s coastal lines are particularly vulnerable to sea level rise and erosion. Around 80% of its population is currently living in these coastal areas. Cabo Verde´s coastal zones are also crucial to foster and sustain the local tourism industry, the main driving force behind the country´s service-oriented economy.</p>
<p>Climatic models ran during the NAPA assessment for the period 2008-2012 have shown that the country´s natural vulnerabilities, along with their social and economic implications, are very likely to be exacerbated by climate-related disruptions in the next decades. These include more frequent extreme events like storms, floods and droughts, as well as shorter rainy seasons, with immediate impacts on livelihoods, infrastructure, sanitary conditions, recharge of reservoirs, and crop productivity.</p>
<p>Cabo Verde is affected by acute water scarcity (both surface and underground). Mean annual precipitation levels are erratic and have decreased considerably since 1970. Rainfall projections to 2020 reveal values below the historical pattern. As result, the country has implemented and regularly maintains around 20 highly costly and energy- intensive water desalination units. Daily water needs of population centres, tourism and agriculture is predicted to increase fourfold, from around 50,000m3 to 160,000m3 by 2030 and thus the potential of various sustainable water supply and mobilization solutions will need to be better explored going forward.</p>
<p>Despite the existence of wastewater treatment facilities in the main urban areas, wastewater remains scarcely managed across the islands of Cabo Verde. Cabo Verde plans an ambitious operational overhaul of its sanitation management system to overcome infrastructure challenges, in particular, extending the water supply network, improving sewage collection and disposal, and properly harvesting and storing rainwater/storm water runoffs.</p>
<p>Adapting its fragile ecosystems to climate change is a key priority for Cabo Verde. Table 6 below summarizes existing policies and actions to increase the country’s adaptive capacity.</p>

<h5><a id="Proposed_measures_367"></a>Proposed measures</h5>
<p>Based on the analysis already carried-out during the NAPA process, Cabo Verde now seeks international support to further develop the necessary strategies and national policies to establish an integrated framework that increases the country’s overall adaptive capacity, as well as the level of resilience of those most vulnerable to climatic variability and climate change.</p>
<p>Building on the priorities identified during the development of the NAPA process, Cabo Verde proposes to focus its adaptation actions on the following strategic axes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Promoting integrated water resources management, guaranteeing stable and adequate water supply (for consumption, agriculture, ecosystems and tourism);</li>
<li>Increasing adaptive capacities of the agro-silvo-pastoral production systems in order to ensure and improve national food production, and promoting Cabo Verde´s blue economy; and</li>
<li>Protecting and preventing degradation of the coastal zones and their habitat.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, Cabo Verde will further expand on measures and actions already initiated with international support to other areas of the country, such as increasing groundwater reserves and land conservation practices, implementing measures to mitigate floods and intercept runoff, and expanding more-efficient irrigation practices (e.g., drip irrigation, drainage and irrigation monitoring, and crop adaptation techniques).</p>
<p>Table 7 below identifies the key adaptation actions to be implemented by Cabo Verde with a view to achieve the above stated priorities. Financing needs and flows for implementing the proposed adaptation activities still need to be assessed and determined.</p>

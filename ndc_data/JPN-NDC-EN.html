<h1><a id="Submission_of_Japans_Intended_Nationally_Determined_Contribution_INDC_1"></a>Submission of Japan’s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC)</h1>
<p>Japan is pleased to communicate its intended nationally determined contribution, as well as information to facilitate the clarity, transparency, and understanding of the contribution.</p>
<p>Climate change is a global challenge. To solve the problem, it is essential to establish a fair and effective new international framework which is applicable to all major Parties. Japan will contribute, in cooperation with other Parties, to the establishment of such an international framework at the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).</p>
<p>Thereunder, Japan will, together with all major emitters, undertake domestic emission reductions and also contribute to reducing global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through Japan’s leading technologies and support for developing countries.</p>
<p>Having faced a drastic change in its circumstances with regard to energy due to the Great East Japan Earthquake and the accident at the Tokyo Electric Power Company’s Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Station, Japan decided the new Strategic Energy Plan last year as a starting point for reviewing and rebuilding our energy strategy from scratch.</p>
<p>Japan’s INDC towards post-2020 GHG emission reductions is at the level of a reduction of 26.0% by fiscal year (FY) 2030 compared to FY 2013 (25.4% reduction compared to FY 2005) (approximately 1.042 billion t-CO<sub>2</sub> eq. as 2030 emissions), ensuring consistency with its energy mix<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>, set as a feasible reduction target by bottom-up calculation with concrete policies, measures and individual technologies taking into adequate consideration, inter alia, technological and cost constraints, and set based on the amount of domestic emission reductions and removals assumed to be obtained.</p>
<p><em>Fairness and Ambition</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Japan’s GHG emissions per gross domestic product (GDP) are 0.29 kg-CO<sub>2</sub>eq./U.S. dollar in 2013 and per capita are 11t-CO<sub>2</sub>eq./person in 2013, while the energy efficiency of the country as a whole (primary energy supply/GDP) is 95 t of oil equivalent/U.S. million dollars in 2013, all of which are already at the leading level among developed countries.</li>
<li>While it is generally analyzed that the marginal cost of reducing GHG emissions is high in Japan due, <em>inter alia</em>, to the measures taken so far, the indicators noted above are projected to improve by around 20 to 40% by 2030 with further measures to reduce emissions.</li>
<li>Japan’s INDC is highly transparent and concrete, as it has been drawn up by accumulating concrete policies and measures for major sectors with clear breakdowns. Each Party’s submission and sharing of information on each sector in this manner would contribute to improving transparency, ensuring fairness, and also enabling effective reviews. This would promote sector-by-sector actions, which would lead to fair and efficient reductions of global emissions.</li>
<li>For example, with regard to Japan’s industrial sectors, both steel (converter steel production) and cement (clinker production) have attained the world’s highest level of energy efficiency, but further improvement is planned through specific policies and measures listed in the attached documents, such as promotion and enhancement of the industries’ action plans towards a low carbon society.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Contribution towards achieving the objective of the Convention as set out in its Article 2</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Towards achieving the ultimate objective of the UNFCCC, in order to hold the increase in global temperatures below 2 degrees Celsius, it is indispensable to take measures for long-term emission reductions globally. Japan’s INDC is consistent with the long-term emission pathways up to 2050 to achieve the 2 degrees Celsius goal as presented in the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and with the goal the country upholds, namely, “the goal of achieving at least a 50% reduction of global GHG emissions by 2050, and as a part of this, the goal of developed countries reducing GHG emissions in aggregate by 80% or more by 2050”. Japan will contribute proactively to these long-term reductions, through its GHG emission reduction measures presented in its INDC, and through actions that will be continuously taken into the future such as development and diffusion of low-carbon technologies and transition to a low-carbon socio-economic structure.</li>

<ul>
<li>Japan’s INDC has been developed, taking into account, inter alia, decisions of the COP, actions by other countries, progress in deliberations on a future framework under the Convention, and domestic consideration of the energy policies and its energy mix.</li>
<li>The INDC was considered through discussions open to the public at the Joint Experts’ Meeting of the Central Environment Council (Subcommittee on Global Warming Measurement after 2020, Global Environment Committee) and the Industrial Structure Council (INDC WG, Global Environment Subcommittee, Committee on Industrial Science and Technology Policy and Environment).</li>
<li>Energy policies and the energy mix were considered through open discussions at the Advisory Committee for Natural Resources and Energy.</li>
<li>The main policies and measures that are expected, at this time, to be implemented for reduction of GHG emissions and removals are listed in the reference information attached.</li>
<li>Based on the discussions above, the Global Warming Prevention Headquarters (ministerial decision-making for global warming countermeasures) developed a draft INDC. After going through public comment procedure, it made a final decision on the INDC.</li>
<li>Japan is to develop the Plan for Global Warming Countermeasures based on the Act on Promotion of Global Warming Countermeasures.</li>
</ul>
<p>Assumptions and methodologies</p>
<ul>
<li>Methodologies are in line with the Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories prepared by the IPCC, and adopted by the COP.</li>
<li>The metrics used for the total GHG emissions and removals is the Global Warming Potentials of a 100-year time horizon which were presented in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report.</li>
<li>Removals by LULUCF sector are accounted in line with approaches equivalent to those under the Kyoto Protocol.</li>
<li>The Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM) is not included as a basis of the bottom-up calculation of Japan’s emission reduction target, but the amount of emission reductions and removals acquired by Japan under the JCM will be appropriately counted as Japan’s reduction.</li>
<li>These methodologies are subject to change depending on the progress of future international negotiations on estimating and accounting rules.</li>

<h5><a id="2_Removals_by_LULUCF_115"></a><strong><em>2. Removals by LULUCF</em></strong></h5>
<p>The target for removals is set as approximately 37 million t-CO<sub>2</sub> in FY 2013 (corresponding to 2.6% reduction of total emissions (corresponding to 2.6% reduction of total emissions in FY 2005)) (approximately 27.8 million t-CO<sub>2</sub> by forest carbon sinks measures (corresponding to 2.0% of total emissions in FY 2013 (corresponding to 2.0% reduction of total emissions in FY 2005)), and approximately 9.1 million t-CO<sub>2</sub> by cropland management, grazing land management and revegetation (corresponding to 0.6% reduction of total emissions in FY 2013 (corresponding to 0.7% reduction of total emissions in FY 2005))).</p>
<h5><a id="3_JCM_and_other_international_contributions_118"></a><strong><em>3. JCM and other international contributions</em></strong></h5>
<p>Japan establishes and implements the JCM in order both to appropriately evaluate contributions from Japan to GHG emission reductions or removals in a quantitative manner achieved through the diffusion of low carbon technologies, products, systems, services, and infrastructure as well as implementation of mitigation actions in developing countries, and to use them to achieve Japan’s emission reduction target. Apart from contributions achieved through private-sector based projects, accumulated emission reductions or removals by FY 2030 through governmental JCM programs to be undertaken within the government’s annual budget are estimated to be ranging from 50 to 100 million t-CO<sub>2</sub>. As part of international contributions other than the JCM, worldwide emission reduction potential in FY 2030 through the diffusion of leading technologies by Japanese industries’ actions is estimated to be at least 1 billion t-CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>Japan will also actively contribute internationally towards, inter alia, human resource development and promotion of development and diffusion of technologies relating to emission reductions in developing countries.</p>

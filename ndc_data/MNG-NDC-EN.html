<h3><a id="Introduction_3"></a>Introduction</h3>
<p>Mongolia is fully committed to the UNFCCC negotiation process towards adopting at COP21 a legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention, applicable to all Parties, in line with confining global warming below 2°C. Mongolia hereby communicates its intended nationally determined contribution to reiterate its determination to support the multilateral negotiation process and international community efforts in fulfilling the objectives of the UNFCCC.</p>
<h3><a id="National_context_7"></a>National context</h3>
<p>Mongolia is a landlocked country located in the centre of the Eurasian continent in a temperate climate zone. The climate is characterised by high fluctuations and extremes in temperature and precipitation. The annual mean temperature ranges from -8°C to 6°C across regions and the annual precipitation varies from 50 mm in the Gobi desert to 400 mm in the northern mountainous area. Climate change assessments undertaken in Mongolia in 2009 and 2014, demonstrated that fragile ecosystems, a reliance on pastoral animal husbandry and rain-fed agriculture, and the growing population with a tendency of urbanization, all combine to make Mongolia’s socio-economic development vulnerable to climate change.</p>
<h3><a id="Development_of_Mongolias_INDC_11"></a>Development of Mongolia’s INDC</h3>
<p>Mongolia’s INDC has its conceptual roots in the Green Development Policy of Mongolia, approved by the Parliament in 2014, to which key sectorial action plans at the national level, including energy sector, are being adjusted. Key indicators for measuring progress in the implementation of the Green Development Policy include, among others, efficient use of energy, GHG emissions and ecological footprint per unit of GDP. The National Action Programme on Climate Change (NAPCC) endorsed by the Parliament 2011 includes concrete measures in response to climate change covering all principal sectors of economy. These and other relevant national level policy documents served as a basis for the development of Mongolia’s INDC, which was shaped and finalized through comprehensive consultation exercises with a broad range of stakeholders.</p>
<h3><a id="Mitigation_contribution_15"></a>Mitigation contribution</h3>
<p>In its INDC, Mongolia has outlined a series of policies and measures that the country commits to implement up to 2030, in the energy, industry, agriculture and waste sectors. The expected mitigation impact of these policies and measures will be a 14% reduction in total national GHG emissions excluding Land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) by 2030, compared to the projected emissions under a business as usual scenario. Those and other potentially more ambitious commitments are contingent upon gaining access to new technologies and sources of finance through internationally agreed mechanisms and instruments under the auspices of the UNFCCC (see Annex A).</p>
<h3><a id="Adaptation_component_19"></a>Adaptation component</h3>
<p>The melting of permafrost and glaciers, surface water shortages, and soil and pasture degradation have been identified as particular challenges faced by Mongolia as a result of climate change. Due to a high degree of vulnerability to climate change, adaptation is particularly important for Mongolia, and as such a distinct adaptation component is therefore included in the INDC. The selection of priorities for the adaptation component is based on a detailed analysis of the expected impacts, potential solutions and challenges, and of possible synergies between adaptation and mitigation activities (see Annex B).</p>

<h4><a id="3b_Additional_actions_50"></a>3b. Additional actions</h4>
<p>Mongolia is also interested to pursue some additional mitigation actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce fuel use in individual households through improving stove efficiency (with co-benefit of air pollution reduction),</li>
<li>Transport (development of a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system and improvement of the public transport system in Ulaanbaatar),</li>
<li>Agriculture (development of a comprehensive plan for emission reductions in the livestock sub-sector for implementation between 2020 and 2030),</li>
<li>Waste sector (development of a waste management plan, including recycling, waste-to-energy, and best management practices),</li>
<li>Industry (motor-efficiency and housekeeping improvements).</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, in the forestry sector, a programme is underway to develop a detailed inventory along with the identification of mitigation options. In future communications, Mongolia intends to include actions for mitigation in the forestry sector to reduce GHG emissions from deforestation and forest degradation by 2% by 2020 and 5% by 2030 (according to State policy on forest, 2015).</p>
<h3><a id="4_Sectors_59"></a>4. Sectors</h3>
<p>The INDC of Mongolia includes proposed measures and additional actions for energy (including transport), industrial processes, agriculture and waste. Projected emissions by sector for 2010 and 2030 are shown in Figure 1.<br>
<img src="MNG-1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Figure 1. GHG emissions share by sector in 2010 and 2030 [forecast, excluding LULUCF].<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>GHG emissions, reported here, exclude LULUCF sector, which are currently being estimated through the preparation of a national GHG inventory, within scope of the responsibility of the Ministry of Environment, Green Development and Tourism of Mongolia (MEGDT).</p>
<h3><a id="5_GHG_emission_reductions_69"></a>5. GHG emission reductions</h3>
<p>In order to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding, this section provides an indicative estimate of potential emission reductions for the measures targeting all major GHG gases (CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O) in the sectors mentioned.</p>
<p>The cumulative impact of the measures listed in Table 1 is estimated to result in approximately an annual reduction of 7.3 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>-eq. of economy-wide emissions in 2030, corresponding to a 14% reduction compared to a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, excluding LULUCF.</p>
<p><img src="MNG-2.png" alt=""><br>
<em>Figure 2. Indicative potential emission reductions of the measures compared to BAU emissions</em></p>
<h3><a id="6_Accounting_methodologies_77"></a>6. Accounting methodologies</h3>
<p>The latest official GHG emissions inventory was compiled for the year 2006 using the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, as described in Mongolia’s Second National Communication (SNC). The projected emissions for 2010, as indicated in this document, were presented in the SNC. The BAU baseline was defined according to the methodology given in Mongolia’s SNC.</p>
<p>Indicative emission reductions were determined using LEAP modelling (energy: power and heat; energy: transport) and Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (industry). A description of the methodology could be found in the INDC detailed report. The potential impact of agricultural emission reduction measures could not be estimated due to lack of available background information, and are thus not included in the indicative estimate. Actual and forecast emission reductions will be recalculated annually, based on improved data availability and appropriate adjustments to the BAU baseline’s assumptions.</p>
<h3><a id="7_Fairness_and_ambition_82"></a>7. Fairness and ambition</h3>
<p>Mongolia has a low responsibility for climate change mitigation in terms of its historic emissions, and limited capacity due to relatively challenging environmental conditions including a long lasting heating season, a coal based electricity production system, a lack of access to cleaner fossil fuels and a highly dispersed population particularly in remote areas (lack of access to the electricity grid). This has led to a high emissions per capita ratio. Mongolia is committed to the decarbonisation of its growing economy and intends to reduce its emissions intensity by implementing the proposed measures.</p>
<p>The proposed targets have their origins in the Green Development Policy of Mongolia, which is an over- arching and comprehensive approach to deliver low-carbon economic growth taking into account national circumstances in the context of its sustainable development. This ambitious strategy mainstreams both mitigation and adaptation in a way to reduce social and environmental vulnerability. Parliamentary approval of the most significant energy measures, and corresponding commitment to implement an important part of the mitigation actions with domestic means, demonstrates the ambition of the Mongolian Government.</p>
<h3><a id="8_Planning_process_and_means_of_implementation_87"></a>8. Planning process and means of implementation</h3>
<p><em>Planning Processes</em><br>
The Ministry of Environment, Green Development and Tourism is the key ministry to develop, update and implement climate related policies. In addition, other line ministries including the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Building and Urban Development, Ministry of Road and Transport and Ministry of Agriculture will be involved.</p>
<p>The elaboration of this INDC involved a multi-stakeholder process and consultations with key public bodies. It is largely based on existing legal frameworks and adopted policies of the Mongolian government, approved by the Parliament. Domestic legally-binding legislation already in place includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Green development policy, 2014 (2014-2030)</li>
<li>National Action Programme on Climate Change (NAPCC), 2011 (2011-2021)</li>
<li>State policy on energy, 2015 (2015-2030)</li>
<li>National agriculture development policy, 2010 (2010-2021)</li>
<li>State policy on forest, 2015 (2016-2030)</li>
<li>MDGs based comprehensive national development programme, 2008 (2008-2021)</li>
<li>Law on renewable energy, 2015</li>
<li>Law on energy, 2015</li>
<li>State policy on Industry, 2015 (2015-2030)</li>
</ul>
<p>Majority of the development and climate policies and programmes cover periods up to 2016 and 2020. Thus, during the period of 2016-2020, Mongolia will elaborate relevant policy documents for consultation at the national level for its development and national climate policies for the period 2021-2030. Progress towards the fulfilment of the contribution will be assessed through an annual review of the implementation progress of the proposed policies and measures.</p>
<p><em>Means of implementation</em><br>
The measures outlined in this INDC have been presented as legislation and/or proposed in national development strategies and plans. As such, responsibility for implementation will follow existing institutional arrangements that define roles and responsibilities for the relevant sectors. In order to successfully implement the policies and measures as part of this contribution (Table 1), as well as the proposed additional measures (described in section 3b), Mongolia will seek international funding, capacity building and technology supports to complement its domestic resource allocations and efforts. Mongolia will articulate its specific needs, and communicate the potential supporting role of the international community. As a preliminary indication, some specific measures that will be important to reach the proposed targets are described in Table 2, with estimated investment needs of 3.5 billion USD. The anticipated financing modalities will be described at a later date, but a substantial private sector share is expected (leveraged by public funds) to be a part of the funding. Mongolia is interested in opportunities to access international climate funds namely the Green Climate Fund and in participation with crediting mechanisms to implement these measures.</p>

<h2><a id="Annex_B_Adaptation_component_119"></a>Annex B: Adaptation component</h2>
<h3><a id="1_Rationale_for_Adaptation_120"></a>1. Rationale for Adaptation</h3>
<p>Considering the importance of adaptation to climate change in Mongolia, this adaptation component has been included in the INDC, due to its high degree of vulnerability to climate change. It is based on a detailed analysis of the anticipated impacts of climate change and those challenges would pose to socio- economic development. Adaptation targets have been identified, along with the funding, capacity, and technologies necessary to achieve them. Implementing these actions will support sustainable development and improve Mongolia’s resilience to climate change. There is a need further to use more differentiated approaches such as defining the role of passive adaptation based on traditional ways of life, active adaptation based on gained knowledge and experiences, and proactive adaptation involving modern technology and know-how.</p>
<h3><a id="2_Summary_of_climate_change_trends_impacts_and_vulnerabilities_123"></a>2. Summary of climate change trends, impacts and vulnerabilities</h3>
<p>The annual mean air temperature over Mongolia has increased by 2.07°C from 1940 to 2014. The ten warmest years in the last 70 years have occurred since 1997. In this period, annual precipitation has decreased slightly and the seasonal rainfall pattern has changed: winter precipitation has gradually increased and summer rain has decreased in some regions. Climate projections show intensification ofthese changes in the first half of the 21st century. Some of the key impacts and vulnerabilities are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Approximately 70% of pastoral land has degraded, while changing plant composition.</li>
<li>Winter dzud (heavy snow, cold waves, storms etc.) risk is likely to increase leading to more losses in livestock sector.</li>
<li>Non-irrigated crop production is becoming more unstable. Assessments show that wheat production might be decreased by 15% by 2030 due to climate change.</li>
<li>The drying up of lakes, rivers and springs and melting of glaciers has intensified in the last decades. The recent surface water resource inventory confirmed that 12% of rivers, 21% of lakes and 15% of springs have dried up. Water temperature and evaporation are continuously increasing, leading to declining water resources.</li>
<li>The intensification of dry climatic conditions cause the increase of the frequency of forest and steppe fires, the occurrence and the intensity of forest insect and pest outbreaks. As a result, the forest area is reduced by 0.46% annually, and forest resources have been degraded significantly.</li>
<li>The frequency of extreme weather phenomena has doubled in the last two decades. This is expected to increase by 23-60% by the middle of the century as compared to present conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Assessment of current and future impact of climate change confirms that animal husbandry, arable farming, human health, and natural resources including water, forest, pasture and soil are the most vulnerable sectors in Mongolia, and also reinforces the importance of natural disaster management.</p>
<h3><a id="3__Long_and_shortterm_adaptation_visions_goals_and_targets_134"></a>3. Long and short-term adaptation visions, goals and targets</h3>
<p><em>Vision for adaptation</em>: Increased adaptive capacity to overcome negative impacts of climate change, and to strengthen resilience of ecosystem and socio-economic sectors.</p>
<p>Adaptation aims to reduce risks and vulnerabilities for the following sectors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Animal husbandry</em></strong> aims to maintain ecosystem balance through improving pasture management.</li>
<li><strong><em>Arable farming</em></strong> aspires to meet the total national need in crops by reducing bare fallow and soil moisture loss, introducing medium and long-term varieties of crops, increased irrigation with water saving technologies including snow, and rain water harvesting.</li>
<li><strong><em>Water resources sector’s</em></strong> objectives are to expand state protected areas covering especially river headwater areas, where 70% of water resources are formed, to ensure proper use of water resources, and to strengthen integrated water resource management in river basins.</li>
<li><strong><em>Forest resource</em></strong> aims to reduce forest degradation, and to implement re-forestation and sustainable forest management strategies.</li>
<li><strong><em>Natural disaster management</em></strong> seeks to build effective disaster management to prevent environmental and socio-economic losses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some adaptation activities under these goals will also have mitigation co-benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving pasture management would increase the carbon sink of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent to 29 million tons per year, which is equal to 1/3 of emission reduction in energy sector.</li>
<li>Reducing bare fallow to 30% in rain-fed crop land, increasing variety of crops, zero-tillage and crop rotation would consequently increase a carbon sink.</li>
<li>Increasing protected areas up to 25-30% of the total territory will help maintain natural ecosystems and preserve water resources with a certain synergy effects for emission reduction.</li>
<li>Increasing forest area up to 9.0% by 2030 and reducing forest fire affected area by 30% would conserve ecosystems and increase carbon sink.</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, carbon sinks of natural ecosystems will be increased with a capacity to absorb almost a half of the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from energy sector in the country by implementing adaptation policies in agriculture, forestry, and water resource sectors.</p>
<h3><a id="4__Current_and_planned_adaptation_undertakings_152"></a>4. Current and planned adaptation undertakings</h3>
<p><strong><em>Animal husbandry and pasture</em></strong>: Every year, around 1.0 million USD is allocated from Government budget to facilitate scientific, environmentally sound measures against pasture insects and rodents. Monitoring system for pasture and soil has been created and is being strengthened.</p>
<p>Existing national policy documents include strategic objectives to protect pasture, which occupy about 80% of the territory. These objectives include improved pasture management, regulation of livestock numbers and herds’ composition by matching with pasture carrying capacities, improved animal breeds, and regional development of intensified animal farming.</p>
<p><strong><em>Arable farming</em></strong>: As of 2015, the total cropland has been accounted as 750 thousand ha and 450 thousand ha is re-used cropland, which was abandoned. Drip irrigation systems have been experimented since 1997 and currently used for limited area of vegetable field.</p>
<p><strong><em>Water resource</em></strong>: As of 2015, state protected area covers 17.4% of the total national land including a certain part of river headwater areas. Integrated river basin management plans have been developed for 7 river basins out of the planned 29.</p>
<p><strong><em>Forestry</em></strong>: Community based forest resource management has been introduced and about 20% of the forest area is currently under protection of community forestry groups, which comprise 74.8% of the total community groups on environmental protection. Multi-purpose forest resource inventory is under the process.</p>
<h3><a id="5_Gaps_and_barriers_163"></a>5. Gaps and barriers</h3>
<p>Mongolia faces some challenges in mobilization of its full potential to achieve the adaptation goals and targets. Major barriers include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A lack of funding, financial incentives and investments.</li>
<li>Challenges to introduce advanced new technologies and equipment due to lack of domestic production.</li>
<li>Weak management of disaster risks at local level, weak and inadequate early warning systems for prevention of droughts and dzuds, a lack of an enabling legal environment.</li>
<li>Weak coordination and integration among various sectors.</li>
<li>Insufficient human resources capacity and a lack of technical training on climate change and limited engagement of academic institutions.</li>
<li>Weak monitoring and evaluation system for sectors, climate events and programmes.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a id="6_Summary_of_adaptation_needs_172"></a>6. Summary of adaptation needs</h3>
<p>Based on current adaptation undertakings and gaps, the needs to achieve adaptation goals and targets for 2021-2030 are given in (Table 3).</p>
<p>Rough estimations of adaptation measures, listed in Table 3, shows that in the future Mongolia will need around 3.4 billion USD for funding in technology and capacity building. Up to 80% of total need expected to be financed from international sources and donor institutions.</p>

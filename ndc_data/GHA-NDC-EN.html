<h1 id="indc-and-accompanying-explanatory-note">(INDC) and accompanying explanatory note </h1>
<p>September, 2015</p>
<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction </h2>
<p>In preparing and submitting its INDC, Ghana is mindful of its international obligations as a Party to the UNFCCC while simultaneously pursuing a national development agenda that seeks to achieve the long-standing objective of becoming a fully-fledged middle-income economy. Ghana’s response to the threats posed to this objective by the impacts of climate change has been to pursue coordinated domestic policy actions that in effect seek to develop a policy framework that integrates adaptation, mitigation and other climate related policies within broader development policies and planning in order to safeguard developmental gains from the impacts of climate change and build a climate resilient economy.</p>
<p>At the multilateral level, Ghana reaffirms its resolve to support global efforts to define a common future that seeks to safeguard the collective interest of all nations by supporting a global agreement that is fair, ambitious and balanced, respects the right of nations to pursue sustainable development, and above all gives equal opportunities to all nations and their citizens, to pursue and realise their future aspirations.</p>
<p>At the milestone 17<sup>th</sup> Session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) held in Durban, South Africa in December 2011, the Parties decided to “develop a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to all Parties” for adoption at the twenty-first session of the COP and for it to come into effect and be implemented from 2020. Parties agreed that their work will address inter alia, mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, transparency of action and support, and capacity building.</p>
<p>At COP 19 in Warsaw, Parties agreed to advance their work by focusing on the elements of the new agreement. The Warsaw Conference was also very significant in that for the first time in Decision 1/CP 19, Parties were invited to “initiate or intensify domestic preparations for their intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs), without prejudice to the legal nature of the contributions”. The decision also requested the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action to identify by the 20<sup>th</sup> session of the COP, the information that Parties will provide when putting forward their contributions, without prejudice to the legal nature of the contributions. Ghana holds the view that the INDCs should cover mitigation, adaptation, finance technology, capacity building and transparency and agrees with the common position of Africa that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The INDCs should conform fully with the Convention;</li>
<li>Respect its differentiation between developed and developing countries;</li>
<li>Build on established Convention obligations, particularly relating to means of implementation; and</li>
<li>Enable developing countries, particularly, African countries, to fully participate in the global effort to achieve the Convention’s objective, with regards to both mitigation and adaptation, in line with the Convention’s provisions.</li>
</ul>
</tr>
<p>Ghana’s INDC builds on other national documents prepared and submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in fulfilment of its obligations under the Convention. These include the National Communications, Biennial Update Reports, Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) and Technology Needs Assessment (TNAs). Ghana sees finance as an essential part of the whole INDC process. The scope of finance from the developed countries must address mitigation, adaptation, and technology transfer and development in developing countries. It should not be solely focused on mitigation.</p>
<p>Ghana as a Party to the UNFCCC and also to the Kyoto Protocol is committed to meeting its commitments in order to contribute its fair share to the attainment of the objective of the Convention. In view of this and in accordance with Decisions 1/CP.19 and 1/CP.20, the Republic of Ghana is pleased to communicate its INDC and associated explanatory note to facilitate the clarity, transparency, and understanding of our contribution.</p>
<h2 id="ghanas-contributions">2. Ghana’s contributions </h2>
<p>Based on its national circumstances, Ghana has put forward mitigation and adaptation actions in its INDC. The inclusion of both mitigation and adaptation in the INDC resonate with the medium-term development agenda (Ghana Shared Growth Development Agenda II – GSGDA 2), the anticipated 40-year socio-economic transformational plan and the universal sustainable development goals. In all, 20 mitigation and 11 adaptation programme of actions<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> in 7 priority economic sectors are being proposed for implementation in the 10year period (2020-2030). The implementation of the actions are expected to help attain low carbon climate resilience through effective adaptation and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction in the following priority sectors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sustainable land use including food security</li>
<li>Climate proof infrastructure</li>
<li>Equitable social development</li>
<li>Sustainable mass transportation</li>
<li>Sustainable energy security</li>
<li>Sustainable forest management; and  Alternative urban waste management.</li>
</ul>
<p>These 31 programme of actions will drive the strategic focus of a “10-year post-2020 enhanced climate action plan” that would be developed after Paris. In the 10-year period, Ghana needs USD 22.6 billion in investments from domestic and international public and private sources to finance these actions. USD 6.3 billion is expected to be mobilized from domestic sources whereas the USD 16.3 billion will come from international support.</td>
<h3 id="mitigation-goal">2.1 Mitigation goal </h3>
<p>Ghana’s emission reduction goal is to unconditionally lower its GHG emissions by 15 percent relative to a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario emission of 73.95MtCO<sub>2</sub>e<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> by 2030.</p>
<p>An additional 30 percent emission reduction is attainable on condition that external support is made available to Ghana to cover the full cost of implementing the mitigation action (finance, technology transfer, capacity building). With this external support, a total emission reduction of 45% below the BUA emission levels can be achieved by 2030 (see figure 1).</p>
<p>The following INDC policy actions<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> will be implemented to achieve the mitigation goals</p>

<h4 id="outlook-of-emissions-trajectory-up-to-2030">2.1.1 Outlook of emissions trajectory up to 2030 </h4>
<p>Without prejudice to the outcome of our emission reduction goal, the outlook of Ghana’s emission trajectory for 2020 to 2030 is projected as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Under BAU emissions are expected to rise from 19.53 MtCO<sub>2</sub>e in 2010 to 37.81 MtCO<sub>2</sub>e in 2020, to 53.5 MtCO<sub>2</sub>e in 2025 and 73.95MtCO<sub>2</sub>e in 2030.</li>
<li>Under the unconditional emission reduction goal, emissions are expected to decrease by 12 percent and 15 percent relative to the BAU emission levels in 2025 and 2030 respectively.</li>
<li>A similar emission trajectory is anticipated under the “conditional emission reduction goal” except that the degree of deviation relative to the BAU emission is higher compared to the projections under the unconditional goal. Under the “conditional emission reduction goal”, emission are expected to decrease by 27 percent and 45 percent relative to the BAU emissions in 2025 and 2030 respectively.</li>

<h3 id="investment-requirements">3.1 Investment Requirements </h3>
<p>In the 10-year period, Ghana intends to mobilize nearly USD 22.6 billion investment from both domestic and international public and private sources. USD 6.3 billion domestically (28.3% of total investment) will be mobilized nationally whereas the USD 16 billion will come from international support.</p>
<p>Out of the USD 22.6 billion investment, USD 9.81 billion (representing 45 % of the total investment) is needed for mitigation whereas the remaining USD 12.79 billion<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> will be required for adaptation.</p>
<p>For mitigation, the USD 9.81 billion is the total investment cost for implementing the 20 transformational mitigation actions over the 10-year period (2020-2030). Out of the USD 9.81 billion, Ghana will mobilize USD 2.02 billion (21% of the total investment cost) to finance the two unconditional INDCs. An additional USD 7.79 billion will be needed to finance the remaining 18 mitigation actions in order to achieve more ambitious emission reductions in the 10 year period.</p>
<p>For Adaptation, Ghana will mobilize USD 4.21 billion (34%) at the national level. The remaining USD 8.29 billion is the international contribution Ghana is looking for in order to meet the cost of implementing its adaptation actions.</p>

<h3 id="technology-and-capacity-needs">3.3 Technology and Capacity Needs </h3>
<p>Without the requisite technology, the technical capacity and favorable conditions that stimulate innovation, Ghana will not have the capability to fully implement its INDC. In this regard, Ghana will be looking for international partnerships to take advantage of the opportunities for technology development and transfer and continuous up-skilling especially in the priority INDC sectors.</p>
<h2 id="monitoring-report-and-verification-mrv">4. Monitoring Report and Verification (MRV) </h2>
<p>Ghana recognizes that an MRV system is the cornerstone to ensure the successful implementation of its INDC mitigation and adaptation actions.</p>
<p>Ghana’s MRV system for the INDC will be an integral part of the existing national development monitoring and evaluation structures which incorporates sector-based periodic information review through Annual Progress Report (APR) system. The MRV for the INDC will build on the existing APR system by enhancing the technical functionalities and with proper institutional coordination. This will bring about transparency and accountability in the implementation of Ghana’s INDC actions.</p>
<p>The MRV system will be deployed to track progress towards achieving INDC goals as well as any modifications in the priority policy actions that will be implemented to attain the INDC goals that have been put forward.</p>
<h2 id="fairness-and-ambition">5. Fairness and Ambition </h2>
<p>Ghana is of the view that the mitigation and adaptation actions in the INDC it has put forward represents a reasonable level of responsibility it can take as its share of the global effort taking into account its socio-economic circumstances. In this regard, Ghana considers its INDC to be fair and ambitious for 4 main reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ghana undertakes, for the first time, a formal emission reduction obligation to control the growth of its GHG emissions, despite having only emitted 0.1% of global GHG emissions in 2012<a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a>.</li>
<li>With Ghana’s GHG emissions per capita of 1.3tCO<sub>2</sub>e<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a>, the full implementation of both unconditional and conditional mitigation contribution will lead to a 0.5 tCO<sub>2</sub>e reduction in the country’s per capita emissions to 0.8tCO<sub>2</sub>e by 2030.</li>
<li>As a developing country, the lack of fiscal space to finance priority issues including poverty reduction policies including investments in education, health and basic infrastructure constrains the country's effort to finance and implement climate mitigation and adaptation policies.</li>
<li>With the kind of urgent development Ghana needs and the level risk climate change poses to the strategic sectors of its economy such as agriculture, water, infrastructure etc, Ghana must focus on reducing the risk of climate change impacts.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="national-planning-process">6. National Planning Process </h2>
<p>Ghana’s INDC was prepared through a comprehensive and participatory process with highlevel cabinet approval.</p>
<p>The INDC is anchored in the anticipated 40-year long-term development, the GSGDA II, National Climate Change Policy as well as the Low Carbon Development Strategy. Many national policies, laws and regulation will support implementation in the first 10-year period and beyond with the possibility of mid-term review in 2025.</p>
<p>The proposed measures to achieve the INDC goal will build on existing measures and strategies. The existing legal frameworks will have to be revised accordingly. These revisions are subject to approval by Ghana’s Parliament. Details of the national policies and measures that will support the implementation of the INDC are presented in Annex 1 and Annex 2.</p>

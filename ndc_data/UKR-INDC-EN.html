<h1><a id="Intended_NationallyDetermined_Contribution_INDC_of_Ukraine_to_a_New_Global_Climate_Agreement_0"></a>Intended Nationally-Determined Contribution (INDC) of Ukraine to a New Global Climate Agreement</h1>
<h3><a id="1_Introduction_3"></a>1. Introduction</h3>
<p>Over the years of independence since 1991, Ukraine has contributed greatly, with 10.2 billion t to reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Ukraine amounted to 944.4 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>eq in 1990, and 402.7 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>eq (excluding LULUCF) in 2012, i.e. 42.6% of the 1990 level. GHG emissions including LULUCF amounted to 874.6 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>eq in 1990 and 375.4 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>eq in 2012, i.e. 42.9% of the 1990 level.</p>
<p>This reduction resulted mainly from a GDP decrease and a decline in the population and social living standards, which are expected to be recovered and improved to reach the EU level.</p>
<p>In 2014-2015, the temporary annexation of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol city by the Russian Federation as well as the anti-terrorist operation in some areas of Donetsk and Lugansk oblasts have radically changed Ukraine’s development course. The need has arisen to defend the nation, to build defense fortifications along thousands of kilometers, including those on the border, and to increase the production of weapons, ammunition and other means of defense, which requires upgrowth in output of heavy industry products, metals, cement, etc. Due to the military aggression 20% of the country’s economic potential has been destroyed.</p>
<p>After restoration of territorial integrity and state sovereignty over the whole territory of Ukraine, the need will arise to reconstruct ruined industrial facilities and infrastructural networks, including railway infrastructure, gas and oil pipelines, water supply systems, sewerage networks, and to repair and build new residential houses and social facilities. All this will cause increase in the production of metals, non-metal construction items, food products, etc. Ukraine will acutely need multi-billion capital investments.</p>
<p>Ukraine’s INDC will be revised after the restoration of its territorial integrity and state sovereignty as well as after the approval of post-2020 socio-economic development strategies with account of investment mobilization.</p>
<h3><a id="2_Greenhouse_gas_emissions_level_16"></a>2. Greenhouse gas emissions level</h3>
<p>Ukraine defines ambitious, but at the same time substantiated and fair target with regard to the level of GHG emissions. <strong>It will not exceed 60% of 1990 GHG emissions level in 2030.</strong></p>

<h3><a id="8_Substantiation_of_the_INDC_fairness_and_ambition_77"></a>8. Substantiation of the INDC fairness and ambition</h3>
<p>The economy of Ukraine requires significant structural changes, infrastructural development, technological modernization and recovery after military operations in eastern Ukraine. Consideration of climate protection factor in their planning and implementation provides for addressing new policies.</p>
<p>Ambitiousness of stated target envisages making efforts to substantially prevent increase of GHG emissions under conditions of the significant planned structural changes, restoration and development of infrastructure, post-war reconstruction. All these actions will require development and implementation of efficient and effective policies and imposing of limitations of GHG emissions which are beyond current international obligations of Ukraine; as well as require significant financial investments.</p>
<p>Pursuant to Annex B to the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol, Ukraine has allowed greenhouse gas emissions for 2020 equal to 76% of the 1990 level. Presented in section 2 ambitious target on the level of greenhouse gas emissions for 2030 in reference to the base year in amount of 60% is much lower than both the allowed GHG emission level for 2020 and the base 1990 year level.</p>

<h3><a id="10_Adaptation_Issue_93"></a>10. Adaptation Issue</h3>
<p>Ukraine will support national adaptation processes in the context of the international commitments in this field. For a medium-term outlook, the adaptation activities will be considered with the same priority as mitigation activates.</p>

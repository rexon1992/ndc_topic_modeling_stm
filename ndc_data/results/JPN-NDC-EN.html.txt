This would promote sector-by-sector actions, which would lead to fair and efficient reductions of global emissions.", "For example, with regard to Japan’s industrial sectors, both steel (converter steel production) and cement (clinker production) have attained the world’s highest level of energy efficiency, but further improvement is planned through specific policies and measures listed in the attached documents, such as promotion and enhancement of the industries’ action plans towards a low carbon society.",

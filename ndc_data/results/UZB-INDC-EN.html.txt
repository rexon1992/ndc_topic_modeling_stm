A considerable warming of the atmosphere and ocean has occurred, world snow and ice storage has decreased, and average global sea level has increased. The main reason for climate change is the anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gases (GHGs) concentration in the Earth surface layer of atmosphere. The analysis of observation data collected under the World Meteorological Organization's Global Atmospheric Watch Program shows that the averaged carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases concentrations in atmosphere reaches their new maximum each year.", 
"Uzbekistan is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change. Without additional resource saving measures, the country may face deficiency of water resources, growth in land desertification and degradation, increase in occurrence of droughts and other dangerous phenomena, leading to instability of agricultural production and threatening to the country’s food security. Since the early 1950s the average rates of air temperature growth throughout the territory of Uzbekistan were 0.29оС for each ten years, which is by 2 times higher than the global warming rates.", 
"Besides, Uzbekistan has encountered the one of the most complicated problem for the Central Asia region – the Aral Sea ecological disaster. This is virtually one of the largest ecological disasters in the contemporary history. “The Aral Sea, once the unique and one of the most beautiful and largest inland water bodies in the world, has turned out to be at the edge of total disappearance during the life of one generation. This has caused unprecedented disaster and irreversible damage to the local population, ecosystem and biodiversity of the Priaralie”1.", 
"The climate change problem is of the global nature, since GHGs emissions are dispensed evenly in atmosphere and do not observe any boundaries. Therefore, only the international cooperation may help to stop increase in greenhouse gas emissions and eventually to decrease adverse impacts of climate change. Uzbekistan has signed and is successfully implementing its obligations under the UNFCCC. Uzbekistan also acclaims adoption of the new Global Climate Agreement.", "Uzbekistan is the country with developing economy and the stable annual GDP growth rate of over 8%.

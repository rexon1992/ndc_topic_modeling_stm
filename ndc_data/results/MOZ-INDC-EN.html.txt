"National development goals and priorities, climate change context", "Mozambique is located in the eastern coast of Africa and has frontiers with Tanzania (north), Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe (west) and South Africa and Swaziland (south). The country has an area of 799 380 km2 , of which 13 000 km2 are coastal and 786 380 km2 are terrestrial, with an eastern shoreline bathed by the Indian ocean extending to 2700 km. The Mozambican population has been increasing at a rate of 2,4% per year. According to the Demographic Census of 2007, the population was estimated at 20,6 million of inhabitants, from which 48% were men and 52% women. The demographic projection of the National Statistics Institute indicates that by 2030 the country will have about 36 million inhabitants, implying that the country will need to prepare the conditions for Mozambique to satisfy the needs of this number of inhabitants.", 
"The geographical location and extension of the county provide for the privilege of a big diversity of natural resources, namely wide fertile areas suitable area for aquaculture, forest, wildlife and fisheries, important watersheds, mineral resources including renewable and non-renewable energy sources and a long coastline of great economic, touristic and environmental potential. However, the country is extremely vulnerable to climate change occurring through alterations in the precipitation and temperature patterns and increased intensity and frequency of the occurrence of extreme weather events like floods, droughts, wind storms, including cyclones, and a rising sea level.", 
"Therefore, as established in the National Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Strategy (NCCAMS) (MICOA, 2012), the national priority is defined in its mission “to increase resilience in the communities and the national economy including the reduction of climate risks, and promote a lowcarbon development and the green economy through the integration of adaptation and mitigation in sectorial and local planning”.", "However, to achieve this goal, and despite the fact that the Government already has put in place a legal and institutional framework, it is still necessary to mobilize, at the national and international levels, the financial and technological resources needed and also to strengthen the national technical and institutional capacities.", 
"Adaptation Contribution", "1. Rationale and process for developing INDC on adaptation", "Mozambique has elaborated its Initial and Second [1] National Communications and other studies [2], which indicate that the country is extremely vulnerable to climate change impacts. Based on the results of those studies’ and from the experience arising from actions implemented to prepare and protect people, ecosystems and infrastructures from the negative impacts occurring due to extreme weather events, the Inter- Institutional Group on Climate Change (GIIMC) conducted the participatory process to formulate the NCCAMS, which was approved by the Government in November 2012.", 
"The NCCAMS identifies adaptation and the reduction of the climate risk as a national priority and presents eight strategic actions aimed at creating resilience and reducing the climate risk in the communities, ecosystems and national economy. The NCCAMS identifies also a set of key cross cutting actions including (i) institutional and legal reform, (ii) research and systematic observation and (iii) capacity building and technology transfer. These are relevant to achieve a prosperous and climate change resilient Mozambique, with a green economy in all social and economic sectors.", 
"Mozambique has decided to include adaptation in its INDC, so as to consider this document as a means to communicate its present and future great climate vulnerability and the effort that the Government, in collaboration with its partners, has to make to create the national capacity to deal with climate change.", "The INDC formulation process started with the compilation of the strategic action proposed in the adaptation and risk reduction pillar of the NCCAMS, and other climate change studies done as well as the legal ordinances. This resulted in the preliminary version of the document that served as a basis for the consultations at the provincial level and at the central level, in the Technical Council of the National Council for Sustainable Development (CONDES), and with other different stakeholders as the civil society, private sector representatives and governmental institutions. This process ended with the realization of the Forum to debate the validation of the INDC and afterwards with its approval by the Council of Ministers and subsequent submission to the UNFCCC’s Secretariat.", 
"2. Summary of climate change trends,impacts and vulnerabilities", "The analysis of the impacts and frequency of its occurrence in Mozambique in the period covering 1956 to 2008 demonstrates that drought and floods are the events that most affect the population, living in vulnerable areas, and that the latter are the most common occurrences followed by tropical cyclones.", "The consequences of the observed impacts of climate change in the country include the loss of human lives, destruction of socioeconomic infrastructures and property, loss of livelihoods and environmental degradation, including erosion and saltwater intrusion, with impacts in the communities and the national economy.", 
"The economic impacts of climate change are well described in the study Economics of Adaptation to Climate Change: Mozambique (World Bank, 2010). This indicated that the economic cost of the disasters that occurred in Mozambique between 1980 and 2003 was 1,74 thousand million USD. However, this value underestimates the losses and impacts on the poor populations that live mostly in the coastal zones (60%) and derive their basic subsistence from fisheries and rainfed agriculture. This population, the coastal resources and infrastructures are exposed to tropical cyclones and to sea level rise.", 
"Based in the same study, the climate scenarios indicate the reduction of the national welfare. The report projects greater losses, estimated between 2 to 7 thousand million USD (real 2003) for the period covering 2003 to 2050. This is equivalent to an annual loss that varies among 0,6 and 1,2 thousand million USD per year until 2030. The major losses are those associated with infrastructures, mainly roads due to floods, although agriculture is also severely affected by drought.", "As referred above, the country is vulnerable to climate change. Assessment studies have shown that Mozambique is already suffering the negative impacts, of climate change and the climate projections recommend adoption and implementation of measures to mitigate the future climate change impacts. Some of the observed impacts include:",

"3. Reporting on long- term and near- term adaptation visions, goals and targets", "The mission is to “reduce climate change vulnerability and improve the wellbeing of Mozambicans through the implementation of concrete measures for adaptation and climate risk reduction, promoting mitigation and low-carbon development, aiming at sustainable development, with the active participation of all stakeholders in the social, environmental and economic sectors”.", 
"To achieve that, in the short term (2015-2019), the first NCCAMM action plan is being updated. In this Plan adaptation will be included as the National Adaptation Plan (NAP). In this period, as in 2013 and 2014, the goal will continue to be the Action Plan, to increase local resilience, fighting poverty and identifying opportunities for adaptation and low- carbon development at community level through its mainstreaming in the process of district planning and budgeting. As the evaluation made shows that the goal has not been accomplished in 2014, and thereby requires delaying the term of the first phase to 2019. The subsequent medium and long-term goals have also been adjusted to 2025 and 2030, respectively.", 
"In the medium (2020 to 2025) and long (2026 to 2030) terms Mozambique intends to update its NAP in which the goals will be similar to those in the shorter term, but referring to the provincial and national level, respectively. Therefore, from 2020 to 2025, the country intends to increase its resilience at the provincial level and to include adaptation in that scope of planning and from 2026 to 2030 to do the same at the national level, achieving in this way the vision of the NCCAMS – “A prosperous and climate change resilient Mozambique, with a green economy in all social and economic sectors”.", 
"This vision is quite ambitious, has been demonstrated during the implementation of the NCCAMS’s first action plan, and the need for financial and technical support and capacity building continues to be necessary.", "4. Reporting on current and planned adaptation undertakings and support", "According to the NCCAMS, the present and future planned actions (post- 2020) directed at the increase of resilience and risk reduction will correspond to the update of the adaptation component of the Strategy which will correspond to the NAP of Mozambique. The country will update and implement its NAP for the following time periods: short (2015 to 2019), medium (2020 to 2024) and long (2025 to 2030) terms.

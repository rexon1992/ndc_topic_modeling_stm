Losses in crop productivity are mainly attributed to frequent temperature increase, irrigation water deficit, and pests and plant disease. In addition, 12% to 15% of the most fertile arable land in Nile Delta is negatively affected by sea level rise and salt water intrusion.", 
"In terms of livestock production, current evidence shows that temperature rise leads to harmful heat stress, which negatively impacts livestock productivity. New animal diseases have emerged in Egypt, which have strong negative impacts on livestock production. These include bluetongue disease and rift valley fever, which are both attributed to significant changes in the Egyptian climate.", "Climate change is expected to increase seawater temperature, shifting fish distributions northwards to live in deeper waters. In addition, increased water salinity in the coastal lakes in Egypt is expected to negatively affect fish species.", 
"Coastal zones are expected to suffer from climate change direct impacts. These include sea level rise and the overflow of low-level land. Estimations indicate that sea level rise by 50 cm leads to serious impacts on low-level lands in Delta and adjacent highly populated cities such as Alexandria and Port Said. Consequently, this will result in a more significant challenge, which is the migration of people from the affected areas to other areas, thus affecting the efficiency of different services and increasing the financial cost required for their development.", 
"As forth tourism sector, coral reefs which constitute a major attraction in Red Sea resorts are highly vulnerable to climate change. In urban areas, heat islands[1] formed by hot air arising from the increasing use of energy in buildings represent the main concern in hot arid climates.", "In addition, one of the most significant potential negative impacts of climate change is the harm inflicted on national heritage as result of temperature rise, sandy winds and ground water. However, this is not just a national concern. Instead, it is a global challenge since this heritage is part of the human heritage.", 
"In health sector, climate change increases direct and indirect negative impacts on public health in Egypt. For example, in 2015 the negative impacts are represented in higher death rate due to heat stress.", "In the energy sector, the increase in temperature negatively affects the efficiency of conventional power plants and photovoltaic cells. Moreover, the sea level rise threatens the electric power plants and networks located along the coasts. Also, the negative impact of climate change on rainfall rates and rain distribution across different regions negatively affects power generation from hydropower plants.

Changing cultivars to those that are more tolerant to heat, salinity and pests, and changing crop pattern are the most promising adaptation measures at the national level.

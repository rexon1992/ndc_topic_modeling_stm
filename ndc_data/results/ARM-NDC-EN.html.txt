"", "In relation to low carbon developmentArmenia describes the term ‘fairness’ by applying the UNFCCC definition of ‘common, but differentiated responsibility’, which considers the different levels of historical responsibility among countries in contributing to the increase of greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere, leading to climate change.", "The climate change mitigation actions should not reverse the social and economic trends, but contribute to the socioeconomic development of the Republic of Armenia. These actions must be based on an ‘ecosystem approach’, which is preferred by the Republic of Armenia, since it allows to maximize the synergies between mitigation and adaptation actions in most sectors of the economy, facilitating fair regional cooperation and contributing to solidarity.",

INDC underlying principles", "", "Limit global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to such a level that the global average temperature does not exceed 2°C", "Ensure distribution of the GHG emissions limitation burden between countries based on the principle of equity, taking into account the rights of present and future generations to use resources, and the equal rights of humans to impact the climatic system.",

"", "2. Mitigation of climate change", "1) Applied definitions", "a. GHG emissions limiting volume - the total volume of GHG emissions, which ensures the limitation of an increase in the average global atmosphere temperature to below 2°C, according to the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report this is equal to 1.000 giga tons (Gt) carbon dioxide equivalent.", "b. GHG neutral emissions volume - the total annual volume of GHG emissions, which can be fully absorbed by the earth’s ecosystems (ocean, land vegetation, soil) and be irreversibly accumulated in the ecosystems (around 11 Gt/year) carbon dioxide equivalent.", 
"2) Calculation basis", "a. The ‘GHG limitation quantitative indicator’ is calculated based on the per capita emissions of the global population,", "b. For global population consider the fixed estimate as of 1990, equal to 5.3 billion people (3.35 million was the Republic of Armenia’s population in 1990),", "c. The per capita emissions limiting volume on the global levels equal to 189 tons/ per capita (1.000 Gt/5.3 billion people)", 
"d. To set the total aggregate quantitative contribution of the Republic of Armenia under INDC equal to 633 million tons carbon dioxide equivalent (189 tons per capita x 3.35 million people) for the period of 2015-2050 or an annual average of 5.4 tons per capita. In 2010, Armenia’s GHG emissions comprised 2.14 tons per capita.", "The Republic of Armenia strives to achieve ecosystem neutral GHG emissions in 2050 (2.07 tons/per capita annual) with the support of adequate (necessary and sufficient) international financial, technological and capacity building assistance.", 
"In case of non-exceeding its total emissions quota (633 million tons) set for the period of 2015-2050 Armenia can credit non-utilized reduction to ‘carbon market’, or transfer it to the balance of emissions limitation envisaged for the period of 2050-2100.", "3) Timeframe", "The timeframe for the INDC is 2015-2030, including:", "a) 2015-2019 - the period of voluntary preparatory contributions. Accept those contributions, beyond the INDC start date in 2020, as «ambitious actions» in accordance with the development index of the Republic of Armenia, stated by forecast “mitigation measures” scenario of the Third National Communication to UNFCCC&quot;. The scenario includes commitments undertaken by the city authorities of the country under the Covenant of Mayors.", 
"b) 2020-2050 - the period of contribution under the new UNFCCC agreement.", "c) 2030 - interim review of the mitigation regime, taking into account possible changes of indexes mentioned uner Para 2, points 2) a and b.", "4) The main sectors included in the mitigation contribution are:", "a. Energy (including renewable energy and energy efficiency)", "b. Transport (including development of electrical transport)",

Waste management (solid waste, waste water, agricultural waste)", "f. Land use and Forestry (afforestation, forest protection, carbon storage in soil)", "Consider 20.1 per cent as an optimal forest cover indicator of the territory of the Republic of Armenia according to the Armenia`s First National Communication to UNFCCC (1998) and Government Decision No 1232 of 21 July 2005 “On Adoption of the National Forest Program of the Republic of Armenia”. To achieve that indicator by 2050 and consider the obtained organic carbon absorptions and accumulations in the INDC and expand the impact period up that measure till 2100.",

Adaptation to climate change", "Basis and approaches to adaptation:", "", 
"Adaptation strategy and contributions are based on the requirement of the UNFCCC Article 2 “Objective”, which stipulates to restrain climate change within timeframe sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change. Thus, the natural ecosystems adaptation approach in INDC is considered pivotal for Armenia’s adaptation strategy and actions (contributions), and a basis for the development of the national adaptation plan.", "The Republic of Armenia embraces the ecosystem approach for adapting to climate change. The approach is in harmony with the environmental policy of the country, can ensure synergy with other international environmental conventions and treaties, will lay the ground for inter-sectoral coordination, and will support establishment of cross-border cooperation and solidarity environment.",

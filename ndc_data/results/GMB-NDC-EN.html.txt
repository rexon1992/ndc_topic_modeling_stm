The Gambia has always shown a progressive standpoint and commendable leadership in the climate change negotiations, as the implications of the current level of mitigation ambition is particularly low and likely to pose tremendous challenges for countries like Gambia. Agriculture, Energy, Water Resources, which are vital sectors for the Gambian economy will severely suffer if global and deep cut do not occur in a near future. For this reason, The Gambia took the leadership and joined the call in 2011 for a universal mobilization of efforts to tackle climate change allowing that global actions protect the future of the most vulnerable countries. By presenting this INDC, the Gambia would like to provide a moral voice for all responsible and capable countries to undertake actions that are proportionate for their responsibilities and capabilities not only for themselves, but for the whole global community. The Gambia is an LDC and according to the Lima Call for Action, it is not mandatory for LDCs to have quantified or quantifiable targets.

Waste management is a major concern for Gambian Authorities, given that roughly 90% of waste is currently disposed in open dumps (e.g. Bakoteh Dump Site). This leads to severe environmental consequences (Sanneh et al. 2011), which can be exacerbated by the expected growth in waste generation volume in the future.

The upfront cost of renewables is identified as major challenge for the Gambia, due to inadequate financial resources. However, under a real discount rate of 10% per year, renewables emerge as the most profitable option, with an associated negative carbon price, ranging between -7 to -20 US$/tCO2e, depending on the scenarios (high or low demand). The economic analysis suggests that even higher shares of renewable electricity generation through solar PV and wind are feasible in The Gambia. Limitations to this are likely arising from the available finance for high up-front cost. Additional cost related to grid adjustments for this purpose is not considered in the analysis and would need to be assessed for higher shares of renewables. Methane capture in landfills also provides substantial mitigation potential at low cost. The associated cost is in the range of 0.34-0.36 US$/tCO2e.", 
"Transitioning to a climate resilient economy will also come at a cost that will be beyond the reach of The Gambia, as a Least Developed Country (LDC). However, the cost of doing nothing now will be astronomical in the long term. Financing for the transitioning to low emissions and climate resilient economy in The Gambia is required for investment in all sectors but particularly in energy, agriculture and waste management sectors. In the energy sector investments will be directed to the transport sub-sector and in energy efficiency in buildings. Priority should be given to renewable sources such as solar and wind. Priority financing should be given to public sector infrastructure investments that are critical to the transition to the green economy. Households should also be a major target of financing, particularly to support energy efficient housing and appliances.", 
"Developing countries have insisted in various fora on the principle of “adequate, new and additional” international financial resources for sustainable development, including environmental activities, to which the concept of predictability should be added. Presently, finance to support activities aimed at addressing climate change in developing countries is generated and delivered by an array of different agents, including the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and Global Environment Facility (for the UNFCCC), multilateral and bilateral development banks (or “finance institutions”), bilateral development cooperation agencies and the private sector. While much public focus to date has been on the contributions made through the UNFCCC and the multilateral finance institutions, rather less attention has been paid to financial flows emanating from the bilateral finance institutions. However, these institutions have a long history in financing development activities and, more recently, have also generated sizeable flows in support of mitigation and adaptation. The Gambia intends to continue to use these international financial sources to access climate finance to support the implementation of her INDC and climate change in general.",

"For sustainable funding of climate change in The Gambia, the Government proposes the establishment of a National Climate Change Fund to raise innovative sources of domestic climate finance. As with similar funds in some developing countries, the Fund will include existing national funds/financial programmes with similar objectives but disparate governance and accountability arrangements, and blend these resources with multiple complementary international and national resources for specific sectors/projects. The resources from the Fund can also be used to leverage international public finance and private finance. Actions to promote low-emission and climate-resilient development must be largely public policy-based and privatesector financed where international public finance is used catalytically alongside much larger capital flows. The strategy for continuous replenishment of the fund will be developed. Public Private Partnerships (PPP) will be facilitated to enable the contribution of the private sector in the financing climate change implementation.", 
"For Long Term Finance and for consideration under the New Climate Regime to be adopted in Paris in December 2015, Gambia proposes adjustments in the climate finance architecture. In macroeconomic terms, priority should be given to financing programs that generate strong synergies with domestic efforts. Perhaps the most important are global financial efforts that facilitate the free or low cost access to technology: global financial technology funds that create knowledge that is made available as a public good, public sector purchase of relevant technology that is also made freely available, technical assistance in building technology capabilities, and human capital formation. A second area may be mechanisms that facilitate long-term domestic financing in The Gambia, thus overcoming its short-term bias, for example using the capitalization of multilateral development banks (e.g., the AfDB) to expand considerably their bond issuance and lending in the domestic currencies of the developing countries, and to support activities that contribute to domestic financial development in these countries, particularly domestic development banks‟ capacity to extend the maturities of available domestic financing. An additional area that may become very attractive is the design of global disaster relief and disaster insurance facilities to manage climate disasters. Such facilities could include insurance premiums with a grant component that could vary according to the level of development of countries, such as The Gambia.", 
"5.2: Technology Development and Transfer", "Technology transfer is seen to play a critical role in the global response to the challenge of climate change. Technology transfer is a broad set of processes covering the flows of knowhow, experience and equipment for mitigating and adapting to climate change amongst different stakeholders such as governments, private sector entities, financial institutions, NGOs and research/education institutions. The broad and inclusive term “transfer” encompasses diffusion of technologies and technology cooperation across and within countries. It comprises the process of learning to understand, utilize and replicate the technology, including the capacity to choose and adapt to local conditions and integrate it with indigenous technologies (Bert Metz et al, 2001).", 
"During the development of its Second National Communication to the UNFCCC, The Gambia identified the technical and technological requirements for the implementation of the Climate Change Convention and its Kyoto Protocol. The Gambia will also continue to assess and determine her technological requirements to implement the Convention and any future Climate Regime to be agreed in Paris.", "Technologies identified and technology transfer requirements (GoTG/SNS, 2013) which will also be needed for the implementation of the INDC include:", 
"", "Climate monitoring, forecasting and dissemination techniques and technologies;", "Energy efficient technologies (High efficiency lighting, Fluorescent lighting technology, Industrial Energy Efficiency Technologies, Fuel Efficiency Technologies;", "Solar Photovoltaic Technology;", "Wind Energy (wind mills);", "Biomass Energy Sources and Technologies (Improved Cook Stoves);", 
"Bio-energy Technology for the Transport sector;", "Waste Management Technologies (Landfill methane capture and Composting technologies);", "Irrigation Techniques and Technologies (Surface Irrigation Systems, Sprinkler irrigation systems, Drip Irrigation);", "Crop Types and Cultivars (Deep-rooted, salt-tolerant tree/grass species, Flood tolerant crop species);", "Post harvest, food processing and preservation techniques and technologies (Drying food preservation, Food preservation freezing, Vacuum packing Food preservation, Canning and bottling food preservation);", 
"Rain water harvesting and Water Treatment technologies;", "Aquaculture; and", "Coastal Protection Technologies (Groynes, Sea walls, Offshore breakwaters and revetments)", "", "The Gambia would require international and south-south cooperation, collaboration and support for the development of its own technologies as well as for technology transfer and innovation to increase its mitigation and adaptive capacities.", "5.3: Capacity Building", 
"In the implementation of her INDC, The Gambia will require support and collaboration on capacity building and enhancement at the individual, institutional and systemic levels.", "Capacity building on data identification, collection, processing, documentation and archiving has been highly achieved in the area of hydrology and meteorology but support would be needed to attain same or level of achievement in other climate related areas and sectors. Although there have been a lot of improvements in acquiring and installing state-of-the-art technologies and infrastructure for climate monitoring in The Gambia under the NAPA early warning projects, human capital to continue maintaining and monitoring climate and weather is inadequate. The National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHS) will need to treble its number of professional staff, increase its middle cadre by 50% and redeploy most junior staff after training on new technologies, tools and procedures. Under the status quo, the immediate need is to recruit professionals and to train weather forecasters and hydrologists. The NMHS needs to develop and diligently pursue a fund-raising strategy that integrates cost-sharing, cost recovery, competitive bidding for international research grants and other innovative ideas as may be forthcoming over the years.", 
"A science and policy-relevant framework for examining global change and local adaptation questions needs to be developed quite soon to make optimal use of favourable developments nationally and internationally. This strategic framework has to be sufficiently broad to include physical and social sciences and their interactions. Important considerations include data gap minimization, cost sharing and cost recovery, alliancing and partnerships and the use of information technologies (IT) to boost research productivity. Tentatively, technical upgrading/technological transformation of data collection networks should be completed by 2018. By 2025, Gambian researchers and scientists should be in a position to conduct joint/collaborative research in a broad spectrum of thematic areas.", 
"While the legal basis for education service delivery responds to upholding the right of everybody to quality basic education, as contained in the 1997 Constitution of The Gambia, there is empirical evidence to suggest that the provision of such education to any population lays a strong foundation for the sustainable development of any country (MoFEA/PAGE, 2011). It is for this reason that the Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education (MoBSE) continues to be preoccupied with the execution of its mandate to deliver quality education in the areas of early childhood development (ECD), basic education, adult and non-formal education and secondary education. Higher and tertiary education is also a key factor in human capital formation with the mandate of producing an informed, skilful and disciplined workforce. Capacity building needs to include the enhancement of curricula for lower and upper basic cycles and the tertiary level of education. As the National Education curricula are currently being reviewed, financial and technical support would be required to integrate climate change and other environmental issues into the curricula. This will be the starting point for the mainstreaming climate change into basic and higher education curricular and the development and institutionalization of specialized training programmes in higher education as is proposed in the PAGE (1012-2015).", 
"National capacity to carry out earth system and global change research is quite low in The Gambia. The organizational history and status of the NMHS as a non-university institution with some research tasks has not contributed significantly to the generation of knowledge on global change, socio-environmental vulnerabilities, mitigation science, or adaptation practices. Most significantly, brain gain/drain ratios in the public sector have deteriorated since the mid-1980s. National research on climate change is largely driven by individual efforts and interests in the wide universe of issues related to global change. Strong collaborative ties forged with the Earth Institute, Columbia University, allow the UTG students and faculty access to programmatic support. Under the German Climate Change initiative, the Max Planck Research Institute and some German universities offer formal academic training, internships and e-learning opportunities to young Gambian scientists. The Government plans to embark on research and provision of higher education on climate change-related disciplines, such as adapted land use, and integrate climate change into the primary, secondary, tertiary and higher education curricula as the education sectors contribution to the proposed national climate change strategy of The Gambia (MoFEA/PAGE, 2011).", 
"6: POLICIES, STRATEGIES, PROGRAMMES AND PROJECTS", "The Government of The Gambia has in place legislative and policy instruments to address climate change and some of these instruments have been used to develop this INDC and will be used for its implementation.", "The Government of The Gambia is committed to reducing poverty and improving the wellbeing of its population and this commitment is driven by the government‟s long-term strategy, Vision 2020. The goal of Vision 2020 is “to transform The Gambia into a financial centre, a tourist paradise, a trading export-oriented agricultural and manufacturing nation, thriving on free market policies and a vibrant private sector, sustained by a well-educated, skilled, healthy, self-reliant and enterprising population, guaranteeing a well-balanced ecosystem and a descent standard of living for all, under a system of government based on the consent of the citizenry.” Vision 2020 is being executed through a series of five-year development plans.", 
"The Programme for Accelerated Growth and Employment (PAGE)is the current mediumterm development strategy and investment programme for 2012 to 2015. The principal objective of the PAGE is to accelerate growth and employment in order to sustain economic growth and reinforce gains in welfare. PAGE takes the new domestic and international economic context into consideration and climate change is fully integrated into all the five pillars that encourage and promote sustainable development and low carbon pathway. The PAGE is currently being reviewed.", 
"The National Environmental Management Act (NEMA) was enacted in 1994 and provides the legal framework for the control and management of the environment. NEMA makes provisions for the overall management of the coastal zone and all other wetlands. The priorities identified for a sound environmental management can be summarized as: (i) improvement and strengthening the institutional framework for environmental management; (ii) mainstreaming environment issues in policy and planning processes;(iii) strengthening environmental regulatory framework and enforcing the regulatory codes, and environmental regulations fully; (iv) Ensuring the functioning of institutional and legal frameworks for sustainable management and protection of the coastal zone and its resources; (v) strengthening environmental advocacy and sensitisation for sustainable development; (vi) ensuring the participation of the private sector, CSO, Non-Governmental Organization, and youth and women‟s groups in sustainable natural resource consumption; (vii) supporting decentralisation and Local Government Reform for community based natural resource management and sustainable development planning; and (viii) improving environmental quality monitoring and enforcement and solid waste management.", 
"The Energy Sector Instruments relevant to the preparation/implementation of this INDC", "There are a number of existing and planned policies and strategies in the energy sector of The Gambia geared toward promoting low carbon development and reducing carbon emissions for sustainable social and economic development. Climate change mitigation policies could discourage unsustainable use of fossil fuels while promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency in electricity generation, transmission and use. However, the success of energy policies depends on institutional capacity building, the removal of financial barriers, and the development of strong legal framework with sufficient regulatory stability. International and regional cooperation, collaboration and support are required.", 
"Below is an overview of the policies and measures for mitigating climate change in the energy sector:", "", "National Energy Policy, Strategy and Action Plan (2014 – 2018) is popularizing the use of RE technologies, facilitate donor intervention in the provision of grants, interestfree loans as well as fiscal incentives for the acquisition of renewable energy devices, implement RE law recommendations for feed-in-tariffs to attract investment in the RE power plants, and publish FiT to give confidence to investors.", 
"National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) of The Gambia (2015-2020/2030) provides scenarios for the contribution of energy efficiency in the electricity and cooking sectors were developed. The analysis of the simulation results provided sectorial energy efficiency targets in 2020 and 2030 which are adopted as what The Gambia intends to achieve by 2020 and 2030 as contribution to the attainment of the EEP‟s targets. The sectoral categories include efficient lighting, high performance distribution of electricity, energy efficiency standards and labelling, buildings and Industry. The effective implementation of the energy efficiency targets and trajectories will depend on the appropriateness of the measures and activities it adopts to create an enabling environment for actors. Some of the key elements of such an enabling environment include a wellconceived policy regime; a vibrant institutional, legal and regulatory framework; mechanisms for incentive planning of rules and behaviour; responsive organizational arrangements; and a well-designed regime of inducements and deterrents for individual actions. Thus, measures and activities are proposed in (a) efficient lighting; (b) standards and labeling; (c) energy efficient building; (d) electricity distribution; (e) cooking initiatives; (f) energy efficiency in the industrial sector; (g) energy efficiency in the transport sector; (h) other sectors (agriculture fisheries, etc.); and (i) cross-cutting measures. The national authority for the follow-up of the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan is the Ministry of Energy. A monitoring system, including indicators for individual measures and instruments, will be developed with the support of ECREEE, in order to follow-up the implementation of the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP).", 
"National Investment Program on Access to Energy in The Gambia (2013 – 2020) will increase access to energy services for rural, urban and peri-urban populations by 2020.", "Renewable Energy Act, 2013 is designed to promote the use of RES in order to achieve greater energy self-reliance which will thus reduce the nation‟s exposure to fossil fuels, harmful emissions and the demand burden in regards to the supply of electricity; establish a Renewable Energy Fund; encourage investment into the RE sector; and ensure appropriate training and certification of installers of RE equipment and provision of guarantees to clients", 
"Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL) Action Agenda and Investment Prospectus (2015 – 2030) is the country‟s plan of action to achieve the set of SE4ALL goals by 2030. SE4ALL is a global initiative led by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon to achieve universal energy access, improve energy efficiency, and increase the use of renewable energy. It was launched to coincide with the designation of 2012 as the International Year of Sustainable Energy for All by the UN General Assembly in December 2010.The Investment Prospectus is designed to operationalize the SE4ALL Action Agenda for The Gambia by identifying and developing a set of implementable programs and projects, including their investment requirements. The investment prospectus features a number of projects that promote renewable energy and energy efficiency. These projects, if implemented, will contribute to climate change mitigation efforts.", 
"", "The National Disaster Management Policy brought disaster management issues including climate change and its impacts into the limelight and has introduced adaptive mechanisms at the community level. The Policy advocates for efficient response mechanisms to disaster management and developing an institutional framework and building capacities at the national, regional and local levels to respond to disasters in a timely fashion. The overall objective of the policy is to build safe and resilient communities by enhancing the use of and access to knowledge and information in disaster prevention and management at all levels of society. Climate change adaptation is fully integrated into the Policy.", 
"The Decentralization Act and Policy places emphasis on localization of development activities including the strengthening of human and institutional capacities on a country-wide basis. In the area of climate change, integration of climate change responses into the Decentralization Policy and the District and Village Development Plans will be initiated in 2016. The Department of Water Resources (the UNFCCC Focal Secretariat) is working with the Municipal and Regional Administrative structures such as the Office of the Mayors, Office of the Regional Governors, the Regional Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) and the Regional Multidisciplinary Facilitation Teams (MDFTs) to enhance access to climate and climate change information by the local communities who are the most vulnerable to climate variability and change.", 
"The Agriculture and Natural Resources (ANR) Policy (2009 – 2015) (GOTG/ANR, 2009) is the medium term policy for the Agriculture (Crops, Livestock, Horticulture, etc.) and Natural Resources (Environment, Fisheries, Forestry, Parks and Wildlife and Water Resources) sectors. It combines policy, institutional, infrastructure and technology related measures to address the multiplicity of supply-side constraints of Gambian agriculture. The overall objective of the ANR is to increase the agriculture sector‟s contribution to the national economy by increasing productivity through commercialization and greater private sector participation predicated on a sound macroeconomic framework aimed at enhanced growth and employment creation. In 2014, climate change was integrated into the ANR Policy and efforts are underway to revise the Policy.", 
"Other relevant policies include the Fisheries (2012 – 2015), Forestry (2009 – 2019), Water Resources (2009 – 2019) and Biodiversity and Wildlife Management policies. Complementary policies also exist for nutrition (2010 – 2020) and gender (2010 – 2020). The objective of the Forestry Policy is to maintain 30 percent of the total land area of The Gambia under forest cover and thus increase the carbon sink of the country. The Fisheries Policy emphasis the maximization of yields through fish farming and protecting the fish landing sites and facilities from flooding, identified as one of the adaptation activities to address the adverse impacts of climate change on the sector and the national economy.", 
"In addition to the national and sectorial policies discussed in the preceding paragraphs, there are a number of complementary plans, programmes and projects, which are closely linked to development and implementation of climate change activities including this INDC. These include the Gambia National Agricultural Investment Plan (GNAIP, 2011 – 2015, Ref: GOTG/GNAIP, 2010), the West Africa Agricultural Productivity Programme (WAAPP), the Global Agricultural Food Security Programme (GAFSP, 2012 – 2016) and the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF, 2012 – 2016). The GNIAP is aligned fully with the national goals of Vision 2020, and aims to support the realization of main national strategic programmes, including the PAGE (2012-2015) and the Agriculture and Natural Resources (ANR) Sector Policy (2010).", 
"Other strategies and programmes specific to climate change include the NAPA (GOTG/NCC, 2007) the Climate Change Priority Action Plan of the PAGE (GOTG/PAGE, 2011), the National NAMA (2011) which includes the proposed development of a Low Emissions Climate Resilient Development Strategy (LECRDS), the Agriculture NAMA (2013) and the Energy NAMA.", "Climate change must be integrated into these policies, strategies, plans and programmes for the effective and sustainable implementation of the climate change convention and any future regimes. This will serve to mainstream climate change into the development frameworks of The Gambia.", 
"7: FOLLOW UP", "The Government and people of the Republic of The Gambia request that this submission is published on the UNFCCC webpage and that this INDC is included in the synthesis report to be prepared by the Secretariat. The Gambia and its collaborators are willing and available to provide further information to enhance clarity.

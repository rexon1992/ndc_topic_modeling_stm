The mitigation contribution for the Vanuatu INDC submission is a sector specific target of transitioning to close to 100% renewable energy in the electricity sector by 2030. This target would replace nearly all fossil fuel requirements for electricity generation in the country and be consistent with the National Energy Road Map (NERM) target of 65% renewable energy by 2020. This contribution would reduce emissions in the energy sector by 72Gg by 2030. Emissions in this sector were around 130 Gg in 2010 but are expected to rise to 240 Gg by 2030 (3% per annum).", 
"2 Emissions">", "The mitigation would thus reduce BAU emissions in the electricity sub-sector by 100% and in the energy sector as a whole by 30%. The target would be conditional, depending on funding commensurate with putting the transition in place being made available from external sources. In addition, Vanuatu will pursue the other mitigation measures in the Vanuatu National Energy Roadmap (2013- 2020), the Scaling Up Renewable Energy in Low Income Countries (SREP) report and Vanuatu’s Renewables Readiness Assessment (RRA) report undertaken by IRENA. These measures would include a vigorous program of energy efficiency to reduce emissions in all sectors except agriculture and forestry by 15%. The transition to renewable energy based electricity could be accelerated through review and revision of agricultural (coconut oil sector) national policy. Opportunities for reducing the high emissions levels in agriculture will simultaneously be pursued with cooperative programs with nations having similarly high emissions in this sector. The forestry sector mitigation will be attended to as part of the existing REDD+ program. The Government is also aware that waste management is an other area that need attention.", 
"", "The adaptation component of the INDC does not seek to set adaptation targets for Vanuatu however it provides an opportunity to reiterate the adaptation priorities as identified and prioritised in key national documents such as the National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) and the National Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction Policy.", "The NAPA process identified and prioritised adaptation priority needs that were urgent and immediate - those needs for which further delay could increase vulnerability or lead to increased costs at a later stage. The five NAPA priorities include: Agriculture and food security; Sustaiable tourism development; Community based marine resource management; Sustaiable forest management and Integrated water resource management. The National Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction Policy identifies five key adaptation strategic priorities and associated actions to further enhance the national adaptation efforts and build resilience across sectors which include the need for: Climate Change vulnerability and multi sector impact assessments; Integrated climate change and disaster risk reduction; Community based adaptation; Loss and damage and Ecosystem based approaches.", 
"National Circumstances", "The Republic of Vanuatu is an island nation located in the Western Pacific Ocean. The country is an archipelago of over 80 islands stretching 1,300 kilometres from North to South. Vanuatu’s terrain is mostly mountainous, with narrow coastal plains where larger islands are characterised by rugged volcanic peaks and tropical rainforests. Vanuatu is located in a seismically and volcanically active region and has high exposure to geologic hazards, including volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis and landslides.", 
"Vanuatu’s national vision as per the Government’s Priority and Action Agenda (PAA) 2006- 2015 is “An Educated, Healthy and Wealthy Vanuatu”. The goal of the Government of Vanuatu (GoV) is to raise the welfare of its people, and main agendas for action include growing the productive sector, especially agriculture and tourism, maintaining macroeconomic balance, raising public service performance, cutting costs associated with transport and utilities, and improving access to basic services such as health and education. Government of Vanuatu is also committed to achieving MDG goals and targets and significant progress has been made towards achieving the MDG Goals.", 
"Climate change and changing weather patterns are already having a negative impact on all the priority sectors in Vanuatu and most evidence points to the fact that they will be exacerbated by climate change related events in the future. Climate related disasters are one of the main hindrances to economic development in Vanuatu and this will certainly continue.", "Vanuatu is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change among the other Pacific island nations. The effects of climate change on agriculture production, fisheries, human health, tourism and well-being will have the consequences of decreasing national income while increasing key social and infrastructure costs. Climate change may affect all areas of life for Ni-Vanuatu people and impact women, men and young people in different ways.", 
"Vanuatu has positioned itself as a regional leader in the fields of Climate Change (CC) and Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and has been widely applauded for its initiative to establish a National Advisory Board for Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction (NAB) as a means of improving coordination and governance around the two issues. Vanuatu’s implementation of the UNFCCC has progressed exponentially in recent years as government sector agencies become more organized and civil society, academic, the private sector, development partners and regional agencies have stepped up their activities in Vanuatu.", 
"Vanuatu is committed to formulating strategies, national policies and best practices for addressing GHG emissions and making a practical contribution to the global mitigation efforts. While at the same time the country is also pursuing its national and regional development priorities and sustainable development objectives.

To adequately adapt to the impacts of climate change, starting now, the annual cost is estimated to be 1.5% of a country’s GDP. For Vanuatu, this equates to an investment of US$9.5million per year. This is substantially higher than the amount of development funding currently being spent on projects that have Adaptation as their principal objective.", 
"In coming years, greater levels of donor funding are likely to be available for climate change adaptation as the economies and budgets of Developed Countries recover from the Global Financial Crisis. As well, as a Least Developed Country, Vanuatu is likely to benefit from the United Nations goal of promoting at least half of these countries to ‘Developing Country’ status by 2019.", "To be in a better position to take advantage of CC/DRR funding that will become available, Vanuatu is establishing strong, efficient and sustainable governance arrangements, and demonstrating a track record in maintaining these arrangements. Ministry of Climate Change is also targeting National Implementing Entity (NIE) accreditation, which will also give it direct access to funding from the Adaptation Fund and potentially other sources of funding for climate change such as the Green Climate Fund.", 
"Technical: A Technology Needs Assessment (TNA) for Vanuatu is needed as a matter of priority to look at implementing a country driven process for identifying and analysing the priority technology needs for mitigating and adapting to climate change. Carrying out the TNA could provide an opportunity to realize the need for new techniques, equipment, knowledge and skills for mitigating greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions and reducing vulnerability to climate change.", "Capacity: At the policy and legislative levels a number of legislative changes are required to reflect the current climate and disaster governance arrangements and clarify the full range of climate and disaster risk responsibilities. Among these are the National Disaster Management Act and the Vanuatu Meteorology Act. At the corporate level the Ministry of Climate Change needs to develop a long term cooperate plan to guide the implementation of its responsibility and also to further guide the agencies under its remit. Agency level cooperate plans are already in existence but lack strong links between the various departments. At the institutional level the need to streamline and strengthen the NAB and its Secretariat is a priority. At the human resource level, no systematic assessment has been carried out to understand the required skills set, existing skills set and the gaps for implementing CC/DRR initiatives. No human resource development plan has been developed. Most training is ad hoc in nature and not linked to a formal professional development strategy. At the information and knowledge management level, systems exist but are not fully utilised. This makes information sharing and learning of lessons difficult.", 
"Further, Vanuatu continues to face several barriers as it strives to meet its UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol obligations. The various obstacles include insufficient institutional and financial resources; lack of research data; information management problems and; inadequate human resources and infrastructure. More must be done to build awareness both within the Government and the community about Vanuatu’s vulnerability to climate change. There is also an apparent need to feed information, knowledge and technologies to enable improved decision-making and environmental management.", 
"Monitoring and Evaluation: The monitoring and reporting on the adaptation activities of the INDC will be conducted at the Ministry level by the CCDRR PMU in close collaboration with the M&amp;E unit of the Prime Minister’s Office, as is the current practice with projects being implemented under the oversight of the NAB.

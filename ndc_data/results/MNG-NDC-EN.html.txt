"Mongolia is fully committed to the UNFCCC negotiation process towards adopting at COP21 a legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention, applicable to all Parties, in line with confining global warming below 2°C. Mongolia hereby communicates its intended nationally determined contribution to reiterate its determination to support the multilateral negotiation process and international community efforts in fulfilling the objectives of the UNFCCC.", "National context", 
"Mongolia is a landlocked country located in the centre of the Eurasian continent in a temperate climate zone. The climate is characterised by high fluctuations and extremes in temperature and precipitation. The annual mean temperature ranges from -8°C to 6°C across regions and the annual precipitation varies from 50 mm in the Gobi desert to 400 mm in the northern mountainous area. Climate change assessments undertaken in Mongolia in 2009 and 2014, demonstrated that fragile ecosystems, a reliance on pastoral animal husbandry and rain-fed agriculture, and the growing population with a tendency of urbanization, all combine to make Mongolia’s socio-economic development vulnerable to climate change.", 
"Development of Mongolia’s INDC", "Mongolia’s INDC has its conceptual roots in the Green Development Policy of Mongolia, approved by the Parliament in 2014, to which key sectorial action plans at the national level, including energy sector, are being adjusted. Key indicators for measuring progress in the implementation of the Green Development Policy include, among others, efficient use of energy, GHG emissions and ecological footprint per unit of GDP. The National Action Programme on Climate Change (NAPCC) endorsed by the Parliament 2011 includes concrete measures in response to climate change covering all principal sectors of economy. These and other relevant national level policy documents served as a basis for the development of Mongolia’s INDC, which was shaped and finalized through comprehensive consultation exercises with a broad range of stakeholders.", 
"Mitigation contribution", "In its INDC, Mongolia has outlined a series of policies and measures that the country commits to implement up to 2030, in the energy, industry, agriculture and waste sectors. The expected mitigation impact of these policies and measures will be a 14% reduction in total national GHG emissions excluding Land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) by 2030, compared to the projected emissions under a business as usual scenario. Those and other potentially more ambitious commitments are contingent upon gaining access to new technologies and sources of finance through internationally agreed mechanisms and instruments under the auspices of the UNFCCC (see Annex A).", 
"Adaptation component", "The melting of permafrost and glaciers, surface water shortages, and soil and pasture degradation have been identified as particular challenges faced by Mongolia as a result of climate change. Due to a high degree of vulnerability to climate change, adaptation is particularly important for Mongolia, and as such a distinct adaptation component is therefore included in the INDC. The selection of priorities for the adaptation component is based on a detailed analysis of the expected impacts, potential solutions and challenges, and of possible synergies between adaptation and mitigation activities (see Annex B).",

The projected emissions for 2010, as indicated in this document, were presented in the SNC. The BAU baseline was defined according to the methodology given in Mongolia’s SNC.", 
"Indicative emission reductions were determined using LEAP modelling (energy: power and heat; energy: transport) and Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (industry). A description of the methodology could be found in the INDC detailed report. The potential impact of agricultural emission reduction measures could not be estimated due to lack of available background information, and are thus not included in the indicative estimate. Actual and forecast emission reductions will be recalculated annually, based on improved data availability and appropriate adjustments to the BAU baseline’s assumptions.", 
"7. Fairness and ambition", "Mongolia has a low responsibility for climate change mitigation in terms of its historic emissions, and limited capacity due to relatively challenging environmental conditions including a long lasting heating season, a coal based electricity production system, a lack of access to cleaner fossil fuels and a highly dispersed population particularly in remote areas (lack of access to the electricity grid). This has led to a high emissions per capita ratio. Mongolia is committed to the decarbonisation of its growing economy and intends to reduce its emissions intensity by implementing the proposed measures.", 
"The proposed targets have their origins in the Green Development Policy of Mongolia, which is an over- arching and comprehensive approach to deliver low-carbon economic growth taking into account national circumstances in the context of its sustainable development. This ambitious strategy mainstreams both mitigation and adaptation in a way to reduce social and environmental vulnerability. Parliamentary approval of the most significant energy measures, and corresponding commitment to implement an important part of the mitigation actions with domestic means, demonstrates the ambition of the Mongolian Government.", 
"8. Planning process and means of implementation", "Planning Processes", "The Ministry of Environment, Green Development and Tourism is the key ministry to develop, update and implement climate related policies. In addition, other line ministries including the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Building and Urban Development, Ministry of Road and Transport and Ministry of Agriculture will be involved.",

It is largely based on existing legal frameworks and adopted policies of the Mongolian government, approved by the Parliament.

Progress towards the fulfilment of the contribution will be assessed through an annual review of the implementation progress of the proposed policies and measures.", 
"Means of implementation", "The measures outlined in this INDC have been presented as legislation and/or proposed in national development strategies and plans. As such, responsibility for implementation will follow existing institutional arrangements that define roles and responsibilities for the relevant sectors. In order to successfully implement the policies and measures as part of this contribution (Table 1), as well as the proposed additional measures (described in section 3b), Mongolia will seek international funding, capacity building and technology supports to complement its domestic resource allocations and efforts. Mongolia will articulate its specific needs, and communicate the potential supporting role of the international community. As a preliminary indication, some specific measures that will be important to reach the proposed targets are described in Table 2, with estimated investment needs of 3.5 billion USD. The anticipated financing modalities will be described at a later date, but a substantial private sector share is expected (leveraged by public funds) to be a part of the funding.

It is based on a detailed analysis of the anticipated impacts of climate change and those challenges would pose to socio- economic development. Adaptation targets have been identified, along with the funding, capacity, and technologies necessary to achieve them. Implementing these actions will support sustainable development and improve Mongolia’s resilience to climate change. There is a need further to use more differentiated approaches such as defining the role of passive adaptation based on traditional ways of life, active adaptation based on gained knowledge and experiences, and proactive adaptation involving modern technology and know-how.", 
"2. Summary of climate change trends, impacts and vulnerabilities", "The annual mean air temperature over Mongolia has increased by 2.07°C from 1940 to 2014. The ten warmest years in the last 70 years have occurred since 1997.

Water temperature and evaporation are continuously increasing, leading to declining water resources.", 
"The intensification of dry climatic conditions cause the increase of the frequency of forest and steppe fires, the occurrence and the intensity of forest insect and pest outbreaks. As a result, the forest area is reduced by 0.46% annually, and forest resources have been degraded significantly.", "The frequency of extreme weather phenomena has doubled in the last two decades. This is expected to increase by 23-60% by the middle of the century as compared to present conditions.",

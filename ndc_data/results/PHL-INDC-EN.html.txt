The submission is anchored on its policy declaration under the Climate Change Law of 2009, as amended in 2012, whereby the State shall cooperate with the global community in the resolution of climate change issues.", 
"PREAMBLE", "The Philippine INDC is premised on the philosophy of pursuing climate change mitigation as a function of adaptation. As a country highly vulnerable to climate and disaster risks, mitigation measures as presented in the INDC will be pursued in line with sustainable development and a low-emission development that promotes inclusive growth. As such, the pursuit of the mitigation measures of the country is conditioned on the financing resources, including technology development and transfer, and capacity building. Furthermore, the support for these initiatives will be substantially provided under a new agreement expected to be forged by the 21st Session of the Conference of Parties in December 2015.", 
"The information presented in this submission is based on available data at the time of the INDC’s formulation. The INDC will be updated as more data become available.", "The discussion on adaptation and loss-and-damage is intended to provide part of the critical context of the mitigation proposal in this INDC. The adaptation actions with additional support from international sources will enhance the country’s capacity towards climate resiliency and also its capacity to implement the mitigation options.", 
"The Philippines recognizes its responsibility to contribute its fair share in global climate action, particularly in the effort to realize the ultimate aim of the Convention to avoid dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Based on fair share, the country will commence a broad consultative process to determine the propriety of the need to peak its emissions taking into consideration the country’s economic growth and development. The country however views the need to peak its emissions as an opportunity to transition as early as it can to an efficient, resilient, adaptive, sustainable clean energy-driven economy, and it is determined to do so with partners from the global community.", 
"The full implementation of the Philippine INDC is contingent on the provision of all elements under the means of implementation section. The Philippines still recognizes the leadership role of developed countries in addressing climate change.", "NATIONAL CONTEXT", "The Philippines, an archipelagic country with a population of more than 100 million, is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and natural hazards. In the Global Climate Risk Index of Germanwatch, the Philippines ranked fifth with respect to the long-term Climate Risk Index (CRI) for the period of 1994 to 2014. In terms of the 2013 CRI, the Philippines is identified as the most affected country (ranked 1st).", 
"While the Philippines is making significant strides toward a more inclusive growth aimed at further reducing poverty and creating more opportunities for shared prosperity, the challenge is to pursue economic development while simultaneously having to deal with the impacts of climate change and natural hazards. Climate change and natural hazards will progressively impact sectors that are strategically important for the growth of the economy, e.g., agriculture, fisheries, and water resource management. Increase in temperature, coupled with changes in precipitation patterns and hydrological regimes, can only exacerbate the country’s existing vulnerabilities, threatening its sustainable development and the survival of future generations of Filipinos.", 
"Recognizing the critical and complex challenges posed by climate change, the Philippines continuously pursues institutional reforms factoring sustainable and responsible use of natural resources, respect for, protection, promotion, and fulfillment, as well as, the full enjoyment of human rights by all, including the indigenous peoples and local communities, gender equality and the full and equal participation of women, intergenerational equity, biodiversity conservation, food and water security. The Philippine government has put in place a comprehensive climate change policy agenda, to wit:", 
"", "Passage of the Climate Change Act of 2009 and amended in 2012 which established the Climate Change Commission (CCC) to lead policy development and coordinate, monitor and evaluate climate response. The Cabinet Cluster on Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation (CCAM) was also created to focus on increasing convergence and coordination among government agencies with key roles on adaptation and mitigation. The amended law also led to the introduction of the Peoples’ Survival Fund allocating national budget for adaptation needs of local communities and local governments.",

"Zambia’s INDC includes both mitigation and adaptation components based on her national circumstances and is in line with decisions 1/CP.19 and 1/CP.20. The successful implementation of Zambia’s INDC will result in an estimated total emission reduction of 38,000GgCO2eq which translates to 47% (internationally supported efforts) against 2010 as a base year. This emission reduction is conditional and subject to the availability of international support in form of finance, technology and capacity building. The total budget for implementing both components is estimated at US$ 50 billion by the year 2030, out of this USD 35 billion is expected to come from external sources while $15 billion will be mobilized from domestic sources.", 
"1.2 National Circumstances", "Climate variability and change has become a major threat to sustainable development in Zambia. The country is already experiencing climate induced hazards which include drought and dry spells, seasonal and flash floods and extreme temperatures. Some of these hazards, especially the droughts and floods have increased in frequency and intensity over the past few decades and have adversely impacted food and water security, water quality, energy and livelihoods of the people, especially in rural communities.", 
"Recent climate trends based on records from 1960 to 2003 indicate that mean annual temperature has increased by 1.3oC, since 1960, an average rate of 0.34oC per decade. On the other hand, the mean rainfall over Zambia has decreased by an average rate of 1.9 mm/month (2.3%) per decade since 1960. The future trends in the country are towards a higher average temperature, a possible decrease in total rainfall, and some indication of heavy events of rainfall. An assessment of potential climate impacts shows that they will seriously undermine the efforts to improve the livelihoods of Zambians if left unaddressed [1]. The assessment [2] further analyzed the negative impacts of climate change on key economic sectors including water, agriculture, forestry, wildlife, tourism, mining, energy, infrastructure and health. Further studies have estimated GDP loss over a 10-20 year mid-term planning horizon for agriculture productivity and its associated effects on poverty levels[3], the potential impact of an energy crisis, the higher cost of treating climate related diseases such as malaria and malnutrition, and the loss of natural resources which provide critical ecosystem services to urban, peri-urban and rural communities [4].", 
"The aggregated estimated total GDP loss by sector was in the range of USD 4,330-5,440 million with the following sector GDP losses: Agriculture (2,200 - 3,130), Energy related (270 - 450), Health (460), and Natural Resources (1,400). In view of these challenges, Zambia has in the recent past developed various climate change-related policies, strategies, projects and programs in response to climate change impacts. These include: the National Policy on Environment (NPE, 2007); the National Climate Change Response Strategy (NCCRS, 2010); National Forestry Policy of 2014; National Energy Policy of 2008, The National Agriculture Policy of 2014 and Transport Policy of 2002; National Strategy for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+, 2015); Second National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP2); the National Adaptation Plan of Action on Climate Change (NAPA, 2007); Technology Needs Assessment (TNA, 2013); Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs, 2014); Second National Communication (SNC, 2015).", 
"These policies, strategies, programmes and projects are aligned with the Revised Sixth National Development Plan (RSDNP) and the Vision 2030 which promotes “A prosperous middle income country by 2030”, both of which support development of a low carbon and climate-resilient development pathway. In addition, Government ratified the Kyoto Protocol in 2006 among other things to facilitate implementation of the Clean Development Mechanism. The country is also in the process of developing its National Adaptation Plan (NAP) for long term adaptation planning and mainstreaming of climate change into national development planning process. The development of the Seventh National Development Plan (SeNDP, 2017-2021) is also underway which will take into account climate change issues", 
"An assessment undertaken as part of the INDC preparation for the mitigation component revealed that mitigation policies/actions/programs converge into three programs which have mitigation and adaptation effects: Sustainable Forest Management, Sustainable Agriculture and Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency.", "Similarly, adaptation measures identified based on vulnerability assessment of seven key economic sectors (agriculture, water, forestry, energy, wildlife, infrastructure and health) comprise three goals/programs that have strong synergies with mitigation. These are: Adaptation of strategic productive systems (agriculture, forests, wildlife and water); Adaptation of strategic infrastructure and health systems; and Enhanced capacity building, research, technology transfer and finance.", 
"2.MITIGATION", "2.1 Contribution", "Zambia intends to reduce its CO2eq emissions by implementing three (3) programs driven by the country’s Climate Response Strategy and supported by national development policies including energy, forestry, agriculture, water, Town and Country Planning, sanitation, and transport. Further, these programs have been developed based on Zambia’s plans and actions and supported by various climate-related activities such as REDD+, NAMAs and Technology Needs Assessment (TNA), among others (Table 1).",

Of this, USD 15 billion will be unconditional support provided by the Zambian Government and USD 35 billion will be conditional support to be sourced externally. Zambia will require international support in form of finance, investment, technology development and transfer, and capacity-building to fully realize its intended contribution. Further analysis will be necessary to refine the required investment cost and determine the domestic support as more data and results of studies become available. During implementation of these programs, Government will engage all relevant stakeholders to achieve the emission reduction target as part of the country’s contribution to attainment of 2 degree goal.", 
"5.2 Monitoring and Evaluation", "Since the INDC is a part of the national development and planning process for climate change issues, it will be monitored and evaluated according to the existing monitoring and evaluation frameworks. Further, this will be done in a wide consultative and participatory manner. In addition, since INDC is a planning tool, it will be reviewed and updated as part of the national planning process.", "5.3 Fairness and Ambition", 
"Zambia considers her INDC fair and ambitious enough to contribute to low carbon and climate resilient economy by 2030 in accordance with its special national circumstance and desire to become a high middle income and prosperous Nation by 2030. Zambia is low contributor to the global greenhouse gas emission. In developing the INDC, Zambia considered the general principles and provisions of the Convention especially those related to Common But Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR) and equitable access to atmospheric space.", 
"In light of above, Zambia will endeavor to make significant emission reduction through implementation of this ambitious INDC and provide leadership in the region through a set target of 47% emission reduction target, with 2010 being the base year. The country’s INDC is guided by the country’s desire to reduce poverty, attainment low carbon climate resilient economy, sustainable development and become a high middle income and prosperous nation by 2030 in line with its Revised Sixth National Development Plan and the country’s Vision 2030.", 
"The successful implementation of Zambia’s INDC is conditional and dependent on the level of support to be provided through the Convention and other multilateral and bilateral arrangements. However, the country is committed to meeting its obligations under the Convention by implementing ambitious mitigation and adaptation programmes across the prioritized sectors. This will support the well-being of the citizens and contribute to the attainment of the objective of the Convention once adequate support is provided. This is what constitutes fairness and ambition for Zambia’s INDC.",

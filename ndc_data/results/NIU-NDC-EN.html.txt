It is beyond Niue’s national measures to address loss and damage alone from climate change. Building on the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) position, Niue is calling for loss and damage to be included as a separate element of the 2015 Paris Agreement, an element that should be distinct from adaptation.", 
"Against a high climate risk backdrop, the objective of Niue’s National Strategic Plan is to build a sustainable future that meets our economic and social needs while preserving environmental integrity, social stability, and the Niue culture. Much of the time and capacity of our small public service is put to devise and implement plans to build climate resilience and enhance our disaster preparedness. Donor support is critical to these efforts.", "While Niue’s contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is negligible (less than 0.0001%), and Niue is a net sink given the growth of our forests, nevertheless we are taking steps to reduce our emissions, in particular in the energy sector. The Niue Strategic Energy Road Map (NiSERM) 2015-2025 outlines Niue’s aspiration to meet 80% of its electricity needs from renewable energy sources by 2025, which would in turn reduce the country’s high reliance on imported fossil fuel. Part of this goal can be achieved through national resources and identified assistance, but achieving such high levels of electricity from renewables",

In January 2004 the capital of Niue was destroyed by the category 5 Cyclone Heta. Niue knows the effects of severe events. It is also seeing the impacts of slow onset events as its underground freshwater lens faces contamination from rising sea levels.", 
"Niue is a small Pacific Island Country (PIC) located partway between Tonga, Samoa and the Cook Islands. The island is approximately 259 km² with an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of 300,000km² and is reputedly one of the world’s largest elevated coral atolls. The average height above sea-level is 23 metres and highest point less than 70m. Niue is vulnerable to climate risks such as tropical cyclones (TCs) and droughts; geological risks such as earthquakes and tsunami; and human-caused risks such as disease outbreaks and contamination of its only fresh water supply. Niue’s risk profile is also inherently linked to its isolation and limited capacity to manage and respond to disasters and climate change impacts. Traditional coping strategies have tended to make way for an increased reliance on external support, as New Zealand fulfils its obligations to provide support to Niue in times of disaster.", 
"Niue has no surface water and relies upon groundwater resources and rain catchments. Groundwater is recharged via rainfall infiltration and rainfall currently exceeds the rate of extraction. However, Niue’s porous soil renders its underground fresh water vulnerable to contamination, from both human causes (e.g. agricultural chemicals) and natural sources (e.g. sea water). Agriculture is predominantly focused on subsistence production, principally of root crops. The combination of relatively poor soils and dependence on rainfall makes agricultural production highly sensitive to changes in rainfall frequency and amount.", 
"Niue has a population of approximately 1500 (2013 census) spread across 14 villages. Large scale outward migration, usually from younger age groups, has occurred since 1971, predominantly to New Zealand for education, employment opportunities and family ties, as well as perceived higher standards of living abroad. As a result, there are over 20,000 people identifying themselves as Niuean that live in New Zealand.", "Niue’s economy is heavily dependent on support from New Zealand, which has a statutory obligation to provide economic and administrative assistance to Niue. Aid accounts for 70% of Niue’s GDP, which is NZ$10,000 per capita. Other sources of financial resources include taxation, government trading activities, sovereign assets and additional support from development partners. Low population, scarcity of natural resources, isolation and high costs of transportation lead to Niue’s economy being far from self-sufficient.",

For these reasons, protecting and enhancing natural resources, adequate sanitation and wastewater treatment are among the government’s main priorities. The risks climate change poses to Niue are therefore highly significant, and the ability of Niue to effectively respond to minimise or avoid these risks is minimal. Niue therefore must rely on the international community to avoid the dangers of climate change. This requires significant reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions so that climate is stabilised to allow Niue’s natural and social systems to adapt, and partnerships are developed between Niue and more developed nations to implement effective and efficient adaptation responses.",

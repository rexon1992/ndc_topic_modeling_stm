"Uruguay will communicate its definitive Nationally Determined Contribution once the UNFCCC has set forth the rules to apply and implementation agreements have been finalized.", "On the presentation of Uruguay´s iNDC", "Uruguay is a developing country, whose economy should continue to grow to ensure higher equity levels in its society. Therefore, the country’s contribution to the ultimate objective of the Convention focuses on continuing its development with the lowest emission intensity possible while, at the same time, building resilience.", 
"With regard to the main activities (power generation and beef production), Uruguay presents specific indicators that show the desired efficiency level for the development of the activity. These indicators are presented as emission intensity per product unit, as detailed below.", "Uruguay sets forth specific targets for power generation, since it is considered the main emitting sector worldwide. These targets are presented as emission intensity per kWh produced.", "Additionally, since Uruguay cannot mitigate climate change at the expense of food production, but rather work on improving the efficiency of the emissions per product in the sector, the country sets forth specific targets for beef production. This activity accounts for 78% of domestic CH4 emissions (due to enteric fermentation) and 63% of domestic N2O emissions (due to manure left on pasture by grazing animals). These targets are presented as emission intensity per kilogram of beef (liveweight).", 
"For all the other emitting sectors and economic activities, Uruguay presents aggregate indicators that show the desired efficiency level per GDP, except for the LULUCF sector, for which the iNDC presents the absolute annual CO2 removal value by 2030.", "Uruguay presents both the targets that could be achieved by means of the country’s domestic resources, as well as those that could be achieved if additional means of implementation were to be provided by external sources, which would allow for an increase of mitigation capacities. Further on, the iNDC outlines the additional mitigation actions the country would like to undertake if granted access to the necessary means of implementation. There is also a list of the main adaptation actions the country has undertaken, and will continue to do so in parallel with mitigation actions, promoting synergy between the two. Having the necessary means of implementation to support adaptation actions will prove essential to meet the proposed mitigation targets.", 
"Finally, in 2014 the IPCC pointed out[1] that “the GWP metric is not directly related to a temperature limit, as the 2oC target, whereas some economic metrics and physical end-point metrics like the GTP may be more suitable for this purpose”, thus calling upon further dialogue on the implications of the different metrics and to “provide metrics that can be useful to the users and policymakers”. Due to the significant impact this discussion could have on priority assignment concerning mitigation policies, especially with regard to the agriculture sector, Uruguay has decided to submit its contribution sorted by gases.", 
"National circumstances, global ambition and ambition levels by sector", "For the past 10 years Uruguay has grown at an average annual rate of 5.4%. During this period, energy demands from the industrial sector increased threefold and food production was three and a half times greater. This growth brought along a significant decline in poverty rates, from 39.9% to 9.7%, while extreme poverty was virtually eradicated, dropping from 4.7% to 0.3%, reaching a Gini Index of 0.38.", 
"Uruguay’s production is heavily dependent on food production, and this sector accounts for 70% of national exports. Uruguay’s total agricultural sector currently produces food for 28 million people, while the country has a population of 3.3 million.", "Uruguay’s food production is expected to continue growing in the future, since the country has particularly fertile soils, global demand is on the increase and the country is to contribute to global food security. This means that Uruguay’s GHG inventory is, and will continue to be, heavily influenced by the emissions from the agriculture sector: following the GWP100 metric, this sector accounts for 76% of current emissions, and beef production accounts for three quarters of it.", 
"The country was able to undergo such a dynamic growth while reducing emissions intensity in all sectors, and for some of those it has even reduced absolute emissions, thanks to strong public policies on climate change, a new institutional framework, both at national and departmental level and thanks to the design of a National Climate Change Response Plan (in 2009) and sector-specific policies.", "Below the iNDC provides a brief description of the recent evolution of the GHG emitting and removing sectors and activities, following the implementation of early mitigation measures, as well as 2030 ambition levels for each of the targets mentioned above.", 
"2_Removal__LULUCF_76">CO2 Removal - LULUCF", "", "Uruguay is a country with no net deforestation; this is quite a unique attribute among developing countries. The total coverage of native forests has, actually, increased in the past 30 years, and it is now 752000 hectares. Carbon stocks in these forests have increased due to the expansion of the area and due to secondary growth, in about one third of the surface. This responds to legal regulations that ban native forest logging and to tax exemption incentives provided to registered areas with native forests, which amounts to approximately USD 5 million a year. By 2030 annual CO2 removals from native forests by means of domestic resources are expected to be around 1300 Gg and up to 2500 Gg with additional means of implementation. Furthermore, between 1990 and 2010 Uruguay afforested 689000 effective hectares with tree plantations, which accounts for a 430% increase of the total surface planted in the period. Carbon sequestration levels in tree plantations and in growing native forests have determined that Uruguay, at the beginning of this century, behaved as a net CO2 sink. Uruguay expects to contribute, from 2010 to 2030, by means of domestic resources, with an additional expansion of the total tree plantation area of about 300000 hectares, which will account for total annual removals of 11200 Gg of CO2 in 2030.", 
"In addition, within the REDD+ framework, Uruguay will be able to contribute by removing carbon and preventing emissions that could primarily be estimated in a further 2100 Gg of CO2 in 2030.", "The aggregate result for forestry removals supported by domestic resources amounts to 12500 Gg of CO2 in 2030, which could, reach 15800 Gg if provided with additional means of implementation.", "Additionally, Uruguay has a great carbon sequestration potential through soils under degraded grasslands and eroded croplands. With regard to degraded grasslands, removals by 2030 are estimated to be 600 Gg by means of domestic resources and a total of 3300 Gg with additional means of implementation. With regard to carbon in cropland soils, Uruguay has broadly introduced no till agriculture, and has recently implemented mandatory conservation policies that reduce erosion and will promote an increase in biomass supply to the soil. Moreover, it is fostering the use of irrigation. The net impact of these measures can initially be estimated at about 100 Gg CO2 captured by 2030. Uruguay would then remove, through carbon sequestration in soils, 700 Gg CO2 annually in 2030 by means of domestic resources and a total of 3400 Gg CO2 with additional means of implementation.", 
"", "2_Emissions__Energy_82">CO2 Emissions - Energy", "", "(94% of CO2 emissions in 2010)", "Uruguay has made great efforts within the framework of the “National Energy Policy 2005- 2030”, to achieve a clean energy mix: 59% of the global primary energy mix is currently renewable, which amounts to 83% for the total energy consumption of the industrial sector and 93% for power generation (2014). With regard to transport, the use of biodiesel accounts for 7% and bioethanol 10% of the total vehicle fleet, both with entire domestic production. Even though a lot of progress has been made in the past years, there are still many opportunities for action in this sector.", 
"As a result, the total emissions of the country’s energy sector per GDP are very low: the emission intensity of Uruguay’s energy sector in 2014 was 111 g CO2/USD, one third of total global intensity (global CO2 emissions of the energy sector vs. aggregate global GDP) and significantly lower than the average for OECD countries. Moreover, there is still an important reduction potential, especially in the transport sector (see below for list of additional mitigation measures), that the country is willing to implement if means of implementation were to be made available. Uruguay will continue to develop maintaining the currently low emission intensity level in the energy sector, and even achieving an intensity reduction of 25% from 1990 values by 2030, by means of domestic resources, and a potential 40% total reduction with additional means of implementation.", 
"Power Generation", "Thanks to the ongoing structural transformation of the power generation mix, by 2017 Uruguay will achieve an absolute emissions reduction of 88% within this subsector compared to the annual average for the period 2005-2009, with a higher consumption. By 2017, emissions from the domestic power generation system will be 17 g CO2/kWh, which accounts for 3% of the global average. This will be achieved with 40% of non-conventional renewable energy sources (mainly wind, but also photovoltaic and biomass waste), in addition to 55% hydropower (estimating an average annual rainfall). Although this figure would increase in the following decades after reaching the hydro-wind complementation threshold, it could remain close to 2017 value, if storage systems were to be incorporated through additional means of implementation (see below for list of additional mitigation measures).", 
"", "2_Emissions__Industrial_Processes_90">CO2 Emissions - Industrial Processes", "", "(6% of CO2 emissions in 2010)", "Uruguay produces CO2 in industrial processes, mainly related to cement production. The emissions are low, even when compared to the energy sector’s low emission levels.

For the past 20 years Uruguay has significantly reduced such emission intensity. In particular, as a result of the 2010 Climate-Smart Agriculture Policy, Uruguay has made, and will continue to make, efforts to build a more efficient, resilient and low-carbon cattle farming sector, by introducing new technologies and incorporating successful experiences undertaken by other countries with similar characteristics.", 
"As a result of these policies, by 2030 Uruguay expects to continue reducing emission intensity in beef production, expecting to reduce CH4 emissions intensity per kilogram of beef (liveweight) by 33% from 1990 values, by means of domestic resources and a potential total reduction of 46% if adequate additional means of implementation were to be made available (see below for list of additional mitigation measures).", "", "4_Emissions__Waste_101">CH4 Emissions - Waste", 
"", "(7% of CH4 emissions in 2010)", "With regard to the waste sector, even though different methane capture and flaring measures have been implemented in landfills (in some cases with power generation) and cogeneration from agroindustrial and forest waste, there is still an additional potential for mitigation. The continuation of these policies will allow for a reduction of the emission intensity of the sector per unit of GDP of 44%, from 1990 levels, by means of domestic resources, and a total 68% with additional means of implementation (see below for list of additional mitigation measures).",

"This was possible thanks to a large volume of investments promoted by public policies. For example, with regard to the energy sector, the transformation of the sector was possible through a public-private investment accumulated for several years which reached, on average, 3% of the GDP per year. The State also contributed to reducing the emissions of the economy by granting tax benefits to investments on low-carbon production capacities, particularly to promote afforestation. In the sector, half the plantation costs were subsidized for almost 15 years. In addition, in the cattle farming sector, dairy farming and rice production, public policies fostered large investments and technical change, which allowed for an increase in productivity and a reduction in emission intensity.", 
"Additionally to the early actions already undertaken and the ones that will be implemented by means of the country’s own resources, Uruguay is still willing and committed to developing and executing innovative approaches, especially in the transport, waste and land sectors, to continue making progress towards a low-carbon economy. However, in addition to what has been stated above, the country needs to take on a significant number of actions to adapt to the strong impacts that climate change and variability are having on our territory, economy and population, as described below.

"Time frames and/or periods for implementation:", "Time frame of the commitment is until end 2030. This quantified commitment will be translated into a progressive commitment over the period.", "Scope and coverage:", "Gases covered: all greenhouse gasses not controlled by the Montreal Protocol: CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3", "Sectors covered: energy; industrial processes and product use; agriculture; land-use, land-use change and forestry; waste.", 
"San Marino supports the inclusion of international aviation and shipping on the basis of future internationally agreed rules applicable to all parties.", "Net Contribution of International Market Based Mechanisms:", "The Republic of San Marino intends to achieve its goals of reducing emissions exclusively through domestic measures. However, the use of international mechanisms based on the market is not excluded if domestic reductions will prove insufficient to achieve the targets set.", 
"Planning processes:", "Since 2008 environmental policies have been implemented with a view to improving energy performance of buildings, production of electricity from renewable sources, energy consumption reduction. Moreover, a virtuous policy has been undertaken in waste management, reduction of solvent emissions into the atmosphere and application of new technologies in agriculture and land use including through a more careful territorial planning.", "These policies will continue to be implemented in the coming years.",

This increase has a consequence on the energy consumption.", "National Circumstances", "With an area of 61.19 km2 and a population of about 32,500 inhabitants, the Republic of San Marino is one of the smallest and least populous countries in the world.

"The Republic of San Marino ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on 5 July 1994 and the Kyoto Protocol on 21 January 2010, as a non- Annex I country without quantified commitments for reducing the GHG emissions. Furthermore, San Marino accepted the Doha Amendment on 20 July 2015.", "San Marino economy is based on small- and medium-sized enterprises. Tourism is thriving, with over 2 million tourists every year. The country has a modest agricultural sector, which offers high quality and genuine products and a well-diversified banking and financial sector.

"In 2014 the country’s energy needs were equal to 259 GWh of electricity and 45 Gg of fuels. The Republic of San Marino is totally dependent on energy imports since it has neither fossil fuel sources nor energy production plants.", "The small territory of San Marino has a limit access to renewable energy options such as hydroelectric, wind or geothermal power. As a consequence, in the last years, the Government of San Marino has promoted the development of solar energy, in particular solar PV, throughout forms of incentives, benefits and bonuses.",

The BAU estimation of GHG emissions forms the baseline for the development of Ethiopia’s Green Economy Strategy, quantifying what Ethiopia’s domestic GHG emissions would be if no actions were taken to limit emissions.

Ethiopia has already removed fossil fuel subsidies to enable enhanced generation and use of clean and renewable energy. 76.7% of Ethiopia’s population currently lacks access to modern energy sources, relying on wood for fuel.

Furthermore, Ethiopia intends to increase its ambition by expanding its forest cover, beyond the initial target for the afforestation and reforestation of 7 Million Hectares, with continued involvement from local communities that are already contributing substantially to the attainment of this target.

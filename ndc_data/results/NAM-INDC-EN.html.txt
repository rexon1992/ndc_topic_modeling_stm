"Preamble", "Namibia as a Non-Annex I Party to the UNFCCC does not have commitments under the Convention. However, Namibia takes climate change issues seriously and the submission of the INDC is a clear testimony that the country is committed to fight climate change. To this end, Namibia has put in place policies and strategies to deal with the adverse impacts of climate change. We see climate change as a major threat to the economic development and the general welfare of the Namibian society.", 
"Implementation of this INDC will represent a major challenge to the government of Namibia. Multiple shortcomings and constraints will have to be overcome while fulfilling the needs for systemic, Institutional and human capacity building, access and transfer of the latest environment friendly and clean production technologies, mitigation techniques and sufficient financing in a timely manner for smooth and successful implementation of the INDC. It is thus of vital importance that the Green Climate Fund be capitalised rapidly in order to provide the much needed funds to developing countries to enable them to meet their intended targeted contribution. The cost of implementation of the INDC components of Namibia will require about US$ 33 billion at 2015 prices.", 
"In spite of the country’s socio-economic development being constrained by various factors, Namibia is already unconditionally contributing a share of its resources to combat climate change. This is expected to be about 10% of the INDC requirements in the future. Therefore, the implementation of this INDC is fully conditioned to the provision of the differential 90% of means of implementation required such as finance, technology transfer and the associated capacity building from Annex1 Parties as stipulated under Article 4 of the UNFCCC.", 
"Summary", "In conformity with decisions 1/CP.19 and 1/CP.20 of the Conference of the Parties, the Republic of Namibia has to submit its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change towards achieving the ultimate objective of the Convention as set out in Article 2 before the 01 October 2015. Namibia is thus pleased to submit its contribution towards meeting this objective along with information to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding of its INDC.", 
"The preparation of the INDC report focused mainly on existing policies, strategies and action plans developed and currently being implemented. In the preparation of this report, we prioritised and favoured options from the very broad possibilities that exist for both mitigation and adaptation, as well as the most attractive ones, on the basis of their potential for successful adoption at national level. Some of these actions will yield positive results in both mitigation and adaptation areas while benefiting other sectors of the economy at large.", 
"Namibia, as a responsible Party, has showed the willingness to tackle climate change in support to international efforts and has already unconditionally embarked on mitigating GHG emissions.

In this context, Namibia is signatory to numerous Conventions and is striving to maintain climate change as a priority within its development framework. Namibia’s development is guided by its long-term National Policy Framework, Vision 2030, which transcribes into National Development Plans for 5 year periods.

The country is one of the biggest and driest in sub-Saharan Africa with characteristic high climatic variability in the form of persistent droughts, unpredictable and variable rainfall patterns, high temperature variability and scarcity of water. On account of this climatic situation, Namibia stands a high risks to suffer from the impacts of climate change. This has prompted government to take necessary actions to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Hence, the National Policy on Climate Change for Namibia was produced in 2011 to better translate government’s will and commitment to tackle climate change. Furthermore, a National Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan for the period 2013-2020 has also been developed and paves the way to the strategic options to be adopted for coping with climate change challenges while contributing to the international agenda to meet decisions of the Conference of the Parties (COP).", 
"The cross-sectoral National Climate Change Committee (NCCC), which was created in 1999, oversees all climate change related activities. The latter are implemented by the Ministry of Environment and Tourism (MET) through the climate change unit (CCU) that was created to follow and monitor climate change projects. This unit also ensures that the reporting obligations of the country towards the Convention are met as and when necessary. Namibia has thus produced and submitted two National Communications and was the first NAI Party to submit the Biennial Update Report which, included impacts of GHG emission reduction for initiatives implemented up to 2010.", 
"Though clear mitigation and adaptation plans have not been fully developed up to now, the endeavour is real since these strategies have been mainstreamed in the overall national policy, strategies. Namibia is presently developing its first Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action (NAMA) and is working on its National Adaptation Plan (NAP) to better guide the country on its way to mitigate and adapt to climate change. The preparation of the INDC report focused mainly on existing policies, strategies and action plans developed and currently being implemented.

"Namibia is known to be one of the driest countries in sub-Saharan Africa, and is dependent on development sectors highly sensitive to climate. Primary economic sectors which are natural resource based such as agriculture, fisheries and mining account for about one third of the total GDP. Income distribution in Namibia is unusually inequitable. With an estimated Gini coefficient of 0.6 (2015 CIA World Factbook), Namibia has one of the most inequitable income distribution in the world. More than half of the population depends on subsistence agriculture and in drought years, food shortages are a major problem in rural areas. Namibia is therefore potentially one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change. The predicted temperature rise and evaporation increase as well as higher rainfall variability will exacerbate the existing challenges that Namibia is facing as the driest sub Saharan country. The potential effects of these climatic changes could prove catastrophic to the communities, population and economy at large.", 
"Thus, adaptation is of prime importance to the country and is high on government’s agenda to guarantee the welfare of the people while reducing risks and building resilience. Furthermore, Namibia is host to unique biodiversity within fragile ecosystems and is a biodiversity hotspot. The country’s biodiversity stands too high a risk to allow these ecosystems to be destabilized by climate change which will result in the loss of such a precious world heritage. Adaptation is thus an obligation for the country to fulfil its role within the international context.", 
"The INDC on adaptation has been developed on the basis of the sectoral strategies, plans, and vulnerability and adaptation assessments to climate change conducted for the country.

The highest temperature rise is projected to be inland. Historical rainfall data indicate a decreasing trend accompanied by changes in precipitation pattern. Projections for rainfall are more difficult and remain uncertain with a higher probability for a reduction.", 
"The most destructive first order climate risks, most evident and experienced in the recent years, are long lasting floods and droughts. These in turn impacted heavily and directly on the population, and indirectly on human activities and resources such as agriculture, livestock, water, the coastal zone, natural ecosystems, biodiversity and health, amongst others.

The CCU is supported directly by a formalized multi-sectoral NCCC for the implementation and coordination of sector-specific and cross-sectoral activities while also providing advice and guidance on climate change issues.", 
"Since climate change affects directly or indirectly all socio-economic development sectors, it pays that all Ministries through their various departments, other Organizations and Agencies also actively collaborate and contribute in the implementation of INDC activities at the local, regional and national levels. Existing local and regional structures involved in climate change related activities will similarly form part of the implementation committees at their levels within their areas of jurisdictions.", 
"Hence, this same structure will be adopted for the implementation of activities of the INDC. The National Planning Commission (NPC) which is usually the government institution responsible for monitoring implementation of the development programme can assist in monitoring of activities stemming from the INDC also. This option will ensure that these activities are integrated within the national strategies and plans with the proper feedback to Cabinet. This will also ensure a good follow-up of activities of a cross-cutting nature as well as those having both mitigation and adaptation benefits concurrently. The private sector will be a privileged partner of government for implementing the INDC, either on their own or as funding partners.",

Multiple shortcomings and constraints will have to be overcome while fulfilling the needs for systemic, individual and institutional capacity building, access and transfer of the latest environment friendly and clean production technologies, mitigation and adaptation techniques and sufficient financing in a timely manner for smooth and successful implementation of the INDC. It is thus of vital importance that the Green Climate Fund be capitalised rapidly in order to provide the much needed funds to the developing countries to enable them to meet their intended targeted contribution.", 
"Namibia will need the support of the international community to overcome existing barriers, for the appropriation of technologies for both mitigation and adaptation, a sustained capacity building programme in the prioritized areas, technical support and funding to the tune of some 33 billion US$ at 2015 prices. The setting up of an appropriate climate observation system is of prime importance. Research will be essential to develop and project climate change scenarios at higher resolutions for the different regions of the country, enable precise evaluation and development of vulnerability indices for successful adaptation in the different economic sectors, assess and adapt technologies for adoption under the national circumstances and develop indigenous technologies to support resilience building. Key research areas for mitigation are forest inventories for better assessing the loss in sink capacity, refine emissions and removals estimates and the development of national emission and stock factors. Sufficient sustained support for capacity and funding will be needed to implement the NAMAs and NAP once they are finalized.", 
"The implementation spans over the full period of 15 years to 2030 and some of the measures have already been planned. These can be implemented as soon as the enabling environment is created and the necessary appropriate support is made available. Given the urgency for actions to curb down emissions and enhance sinks, it is important that the international community reaches an agreement and sets up the needed framework for providing the required support.", "With regards to possible financing possibilities, the government of Namibia tables on the following;",

The analysis of economic development activities as dependent variables of recorded climatic parameters will indicate whether climate change is the responsible factor for deviations from set targets. Additionally, data are collected by the various government departments and fed to the National Statistics Agency for regular analysis to help assess progress and achievement of government plans and enable updating of strategies and plans. These analyses will serve as a barometer and support Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) for identifying vulnerability areas, mitigation activities and other more specific needs. They will also serve as indicators to evaluate progress of both m-INDC and a- INDC initiatives.",

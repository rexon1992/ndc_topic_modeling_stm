It is therefore important that the Paris Agreement deals effectively with the adaptation needs in a post 2020 world.", "FSM does not see this INDC as the vehicle to address its adaptation needs in the post 2020 context, even if these need careful consideration and assessment. Such assessments are being made in the context of the Nation Wide Integrated Disaster Risk Management and Climate Change Policy 2013 and the FSM Climate Change Act 2014, as well as the joint state action plans for disaster risk management and climate change adaptation.

c("", "", " ", "", "", "INTENDED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION FOR THE REPUBLIC OF MAURITIUS", "1.0 Introduction", "As a Small Island Developing State (SIDS), Mauritius is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change and its adverse impacts on socio-economic development. We know that the global greenhouse gases (GHG) emission from major big country polluters are responsible for climate change. While SIDS contribute only 1% of the global GHG emission, they are the ones to suffer most from the adverse impacts of climate change. In fact, according to the latest World Risk Report (2014), Mauritius is ranked as the 14th country with the highest disaster risk and ranked 7th on the list of countries most exposed to natural hazard.Mauritius has a Climate Change Action Plan for addressing these threats. To date, Mauritius has invested significant resources in both adaptation and mitigation measures, despite its limited means. In addition, Mauritius is proposing to enact a Climate Change Act with a view to implementing policies, strategies and plans to further mitigate the effects of climate change and promote adaptation measures.", 
"This document presents the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) of the Republic of Mauritius in response to decisions adopted at the 19th and 20th sessions of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) which invites Parties to communicate to the Secretariat their INDCs, towards achieving the objective of the UNFCCC as set out in Article 2 of the Convention. The INDC of Mauritius has been elaborated on the basis of participatory multi-stakeholder and cross-sectoral consultative processes involving all relevant partners. The INDC is in line with the vision of the Honourable Prime Minister of the Republic of Mauritius, announced in August 2015, which aims at taking Mauritius further along the pathway of sustainable development.", 
"1.1 National Circumstances", "The Republic of Mauritius comprises a group of islands in the South West Indian Ocean, consisting of the main island of Mauritius and the outer islands of Rodrigues, Agalega, Saint Brandon, Tromelin and the Chagos Archipelago. The total land area is 2,040 square kilometres and the country has jurisdiction over an Exclusive Economic Zone of about 2.3 million square kilometres. The country is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, manifesting itself in several ways, including among others, intense cyclones, abnormal tidal surges, prolonged droughts, flash floods and increase of sea surface temperature. As most SIDS, Mauritius has limited natural resources, which are under constant pressure and strain to satisfy the increasing socio-economic development needs. There is severe competition among economic operators on land use. In the coastal zones, land is mainly utilized to cater for the tourism industry. With the reduction in sugarcane cultivation, agricultural land is being converted to other forms of small agricultural practices, such as bio-farming and to non(cid:173)agricultural uses such as property development.", 
"Approximately 25% of the total land area is under forest cover, including about 2% of native forest areas, but the planted forest area is gradually decreasing due to demographic and development pressures. Mauritius faces multi-faceted environmental challenges, such as changes in rainfall patterns both temporally and spatially. Agricultural production may decline in the medium and longer term due to increased rainfall variability. Furthermore, the ecosystem and natural habitat of fish and other marine species are being rapidly eroded due to adverse impacts of climate change, with some coral reefs under the threat of extinction, and natural assets, such as beaches, which are vital to the tourism industry may deteriorate, posing threat to some $50 million in value from the sector by 2050.", 
"1.2 Climate change trends", "Meteorological observations have confirmed a change in the climate parameters of the Republic of Mauritius. Average temperature rise of 0.74 0C over mainland and 1.1 0C over Agalega have been recorded. Precipitation has also decreased by 8% between 1950 and 2008. The frequency of extreme climatic events is on the rise as well as the extent of damage to infrastructure and toll on human life. The functioning of the ecosystem is also suffering in terms of episodes of coral bleaching and accentuated beach erosion. The low-lying areas of the Republic of Mauritius, in particular Agalega, is consequently vulnerable to sea level rise and Rodrigues is more exposed to long periods of water scarcity. The intensification of cyclones in shorter periods of time has also been observed.", 
"Climate change model projections show that large variations exist in annual rainfall patterns. The temperature trends indicate an increase of the mean annual temperature of up 3.8Â°C by 2100. In order to address climate change threats, the Republic of Mauritius is developing a pragmatic approach to develop its resilience.", "2.0 Mitigation contributions", "", "The Republic of Mauritius imperatively needs international technical and financial support to enable it to abate its greenhouse gas emissions by 30%, by the year 2030, relative to the business as usual scenario of 7 million metric tonnes CO2equivalent.",

This is relatively very small, representing just 0.015% of global emissions in 2010. In terms of absolute emissions, Mauritius ranks 128th out of 216 states and territories.", 
"The threats of climate change are in atmospheric temperature and sea level rise, rainfall patterns, tropical cyclone intensity, storm surges, droughts and floods which impact adversely on many economic sectors, and human health.", "The Government of the Republic of Mauritius will adopt a responsible and environmentally sustainable policy regarding energy production, waste management and physical infrastructural development, in addition to mainstreaming climate change education for sustainable development. However, Mauritius has limited resources and is challenged by many pressing priorities such as free education, health care and eradication of poverty. A Marshall Plan on poverty alleviation is presently under preparation.", 
"Notwithstanding the above, Mauritius is working towards mitigating its emissions and implementing adaptation actions. However, the proposed adaptation and mitigation activities can only be implemented in the medium and long term with necessary support from international funding agencies, grants from climate funds, transfer of appropriate and affordable adaptation and mitigation technologies, technical assistance and capacity development.", "5.0 Means of Implementation", 
"The Ministry of Environment, Sustainable Development, and Disaster and Beach Management (MOESDDBM) is the focal point for UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. It coordinates the countryâs actions on climate change through its Climate Change Division (CCD) that has put in place a system to monitor and assess vulnerability and adaptation to climate change that allows for the monitoring of climate vulnerability and the results of adaptation actions, taking into account gender issues. The planning process for climate change will be reinforced with the proposed introduction of a Climate Change Bill. Coordination of the INDC plans, programmes and projects for both adaptation and mitigation actions will be under the responsibility of MOESDDBM and will involve the participation of all stakeholders (Sectoral Ministries, Private Sector, CBOs/NGOs, Womenâs Organisations, on collaboration/information-sharing, MOESDDBM will coordinate implementation of its INDC with those of other IOC countries. etc.). With capitalising resources and a view to optimising", 
"The Republic of Mauritius will require international support in its efforts to transition towards a low- carbon development path through greater utilisation of renewable sources of energy (biomass, solar and wind), and to adapt to the negative impacts of climate change that affect several sectors of the economy. The implementation of the INDC of the Republic of Mauritius will require over USD 1.5 billion for mitigation measures and about USD 4 billion for adaptation measures across all the sectors up to 2030 in the form of finance, investment, technology development and transfer, and capacity-building to fully realize its intended contribution.", 
"Mauritius has an excellent track record in managing international grant support for the implementation of development programmes. With regard to capacity development, education, awareness, research, development and implementation of adaptation and mitigation actions, these will be coordinated and reported upon by MOESDDBM in collaboration with the concerned stakeholders.", "", "")

NATIONAL CONTEXT", "Burundi is a landlocked country at the heart of Africa’s Great Lakes Region, located between the meridians 29°00’-30°25 East and parallels 2°20°-4°25’ South. It has an area of 27,834 km² and belongs to two major river basins: the NileBasin, accounting for 13,800 km² of the country’s territory, and the CongoBasin, covering 14,034 km². Its mostly rural population, with an urbanization rate of around 10.4%, was estimated at 8,053,574 at the time of the 2008 census, with an average density of 310 inhabitants/km².", 
"The Burundian economy is dominated by the primary sector, which accounts for nearly half of its gross domestic product (GDP) and close to 80% of its export income; the secondary sector (industry and handicraft) represents just 17-18% of GDP, and the tertiary sector, only about one third of GDP. The current production structure, dominated by subsistence farming, makes the economy very vulnerable and fragile due to its dependency on climate conditions.", "Electrical power consumption in Burundi, amounting to 25 kWh/person/year, represents just 4% of the energy balance.", 
"In Burundi, activities relating to climate change were marked in particular by the development and publication of the first and second national communications under the UNFCCC. At the same time, Burundi also prepared its National Adaptation Programme of Action to climate change (NAPA). The actions identified in the NAPA covered the key sectors of the Burundian economy. As various sectoral adaptation and vulnerability assessment studies have shown, climate change affects every sector of the country’s economy, particularly agriculture.", 
"The prospects for sustainable ecological growth were defined through Burundi Vision 2025 and translated into a short term action plan as part of the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategic Framework covering the period of 2012-2015. In the medium to long term, the Government plans to engage in a transition toward a green economy. Burundi Vision 2025 makes a firm commitment to prioritizing the country’s protection and rational management of the environment such that Burundians can live in a protected, properly managed setting.", 
"The Government has stated itsvision of the fight against climate change as follows: &quot;A State that promotes development that is resilient to the harmful effects of climate change&quot;.", "At the institutional level, the Ministry of Water, the Environment, Land Management and Urban Planning, with its departments and personalized institutionssuch asIGEBU and OBPE, handles matters relating to climate change. For the fulfilment of its mission, the Ministry enjoys the support of frameworks for dialogue such as the National Environment Commission, the Sectoral Group on Water, Sanitation and the Environment (GSEAE), the National Water Partnership (PNE-Bu), and the National Platform for Risk Prevention and Disaster Management.",

ADAPTATION", "2.1. Climate change impacts and vulnerability", "Studies conducted for the initial national communication on climate change and the evolution of climate parameters in Burundi through 2050, based on the general circulation model, show that the average annual temperature will increase by 1°C to 3°C. Rainfall will rise by roughly 10%, and the precipitation regime will be disrupted such that there will only be two seasons remaining, each lasting six months: a rainy season from November to April, followed by a dry season.", 
"These climate changes will engender a large number of risks associated with the following phenomena: (i) season creep; (ii) flooding of swamps and lowlands; (iii) land degradation and loss of soil fertility; (iv) shortage of groundwater resources; (v) extreme weather events (hail, violent showers, heavy winds, etc.); (vi) changes to the growing seasons of crops and forests; and (vii) unpredictable movements of pests.", "According to an integrated analysis of Burundi’s vulnerability, conducted as part of the ACCES (Climate Change Adaptation for Soil and Water Resources Conservation) Project, it was found that the country’s “hotspots of vulnerability” are located in the north and northwest. The slope of the ridge (and not the ridge itself) leading to the Imbo Plain to the west, the topographical structures to the north and the central plateau are the regions most vulnerable to erosion. The main causes are the highly variable relief and the pronounced sensitivity of those regions to climate variability.",

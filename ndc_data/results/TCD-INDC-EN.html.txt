This demonstrates Chad’s desire to make an effective contribution to the global effort to combat global warming, to which the country is highly vulnerable given the fragility of its ecosystems and its economy, which is highly dependent on sectors that are sensitive to climate change.", 
"In the face of development challenges, Chad is ready to fight against climate change and adapt to its impacts by making efforts to protect the environment, in particular through activities such as planting thousands of trees each year and implementing the national programme for the development of green belts around Chadian cities. In addition to these green belts, ten million trees are being planted as part of the African Great Green Wall initiative, and National Tree Week has been officially launched. Chad has also established a Special Fund for the Environment (FSE) in 2013, in order to mobilise its own resources through the establishment of specific taxes.",

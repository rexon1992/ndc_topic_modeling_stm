c("", "", " ", "", "", "Barbados", "Intended Nationally Determined Contribution", "Communicated to the UNFCCC on September 28, 2015", "The National Context", "As a small island developing state (SIDS) that is extremely vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change and cognizant of the implications for its economic, social and environmental sectors, the Government of Barbados (GOB) ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1994 and the Kyoto Protocol in 2000. Since then, Barbados has actively participated in the Conference of Parties (COP) and related inter-sessional meetings of the UNFCCC, as well as undertaken a variety of measures that fit with the overarching objective of the Convention and intended to build national resilience to the challenges imposed by climate change. Accordingly, with the recognition of the need for an urgent global response to address the adverse impacts of climate change, the GOB is expecting the agreed and adopted outcome of the 21st COP of the UNFCCC to be an internationally legally-binding agreement under the Convention that is in the form of a protocol and is applicable to all Parties.", 
"Barbados possesses many of the inherent economic, social and environmental vulnerabilities that are associated with Small Island Developing States (SIDS). Among others, these include susceptibility to natural disasters and extreme events; a small population; limited land and natural resource base; and a small open economy. These will be exacerbated by the impacts of climate change and, if left unchecked, undermine the sustainable development gains that have been achieved over the course of the country’s history.", 
"Barbados is experiencing more extreme weather events, as well as more subtle changes to temperature and precipitation patterns. Observations confirm that temperatures are rising, the frequency of extreme weather events are increasing, sea levels are rising and coral bleaching events are more frequent. These observations are consistent with climate change projections for the Caribbean region [1].", "The GOB has drafted a National Climate Change Policy Framework (NCCPF), which provides the country’s overarching approach to adaptation and mitigation and is in line with the Barbados Sustainable Development Policy (2004). The NCCPF is monitored by the National Climate Change Committee (NCCC).", 
"The Barbados Sustainable Development Policy’s overarching goal is stated as", "", "“to ensure the optimisation of the quality of life for every person by ensuring that economic growth and development does not occur to the detriment of our ecological capital.”", "", "Deriving from this, the primary goal of the NCCPF is to “establish a national process for adapting to climate change effects and minimising greenhouse gas emissions over the short, medium and long term, and to do this in a manner that is coordinated and consistent with the broader sustainable development aspiration.” Its associated objectives are to:", 
"", "establish an appropriate mechanism for responding to the challenges of climate change;", "engage in regional and international climate change negotiation, planning and response mechanisms;", "effect full stakeholder engagement in the development and execution of domestic climate change mitigation and adaptation actions; and", "conduct climate change research.", "", "The NCCPF is monitored by a National Climate Change Committee that is comprised of representatives of government ministries, non-governmental organizations, and private sector agencies.", 
"Despite its limited financial resources and negligible contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on a global scale, Barbados is taking a proactive and ambitious approach to reducing its own emissions by introducing concrete mitigation actions that will see the decarbonisation of its electricity grid, initiatives to improve energy efficiency and reduced emissions from its other sectors. The country’s Green Economy Scoping Study [2], national Sustainable Energy Framework (SEF) [3] and proposed Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action (NAMA) [4] for the energy sector, form the backbone of this Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC). Inevitably, as a SIDS, while Barbados can show leadership and intention, a portion of its ambitious contribution to reduce GHG emissions will be dependent on technology transfer and financial support from the international community in order to realise its objectives.", 
"Adaptation", "As a minimal contributor to global GHG emissions, Barbados places prominence on adapting to the effects of climate change. The changing conditions will see a noticeable impact on the limited availability of fresh water, agricultural productivity, increased land degradation and reduced fish stocks caused by the migration of fish to cooler waters beyond the Caribbean region. The combination of reducing precipitation and salt water intrusion from sea level rise will compound the issue of insufficient water availability (through salinization of ground water aquifers), further affecting the productivity of both agriculture and fisheries. Barbados will face indirect climate-related impacts including drought, flooding, and storms (physical damage), increased pest outbreaks, the spread of invasive species, the increased probability for the occurrence of vector borne and heat related illnesses and the destruction of key ecosystems which all threaten national productivity and may undermine the potential for real growth. With the majority of Barbados’ population and its economic activities located within its narrow coastal zone, this area is undeniably one of the island’s most valuable economic and social assets. Sea level rise, storm surges and inundation, in addition to the increased frequency in tropical storms, will present direct challenges to the coastal zone, in particular to the tourism sector in terms of potential loss and damage to key infrastructure.", 
"Barbados’ national adaptation response is consistent with existing national level policy, in particular the Medium Term Growth &amp; Development Strategy - 2013 - 2020 [5] and the Barbados Sustainable Development Policy. Adaptation planning is also aligned to the CARICOM Regional Framework for Achieving Development Resilient to Climate Change and its associated Implementation Plan 2011 - 2021.", "Taking a mainstreaming approach to climate change, the GOB has started to incorporate climate change adaptation into the following national plans and strategies:",

"Energy consumption accounted for 72% of Barbados’ GHG emissions in 2008 [8] and is therefore the focus of its mitigation activity. Within the sector 67% arises from energy generation and 33% from transport. The following sub-sector contributions have been identified:", "i. Renewable energy: contributing 65% of total peak electrical demand by 2030 [9]. The country has made huge strides in this regard; for example distributed solar photovoltaic (PV) installation is growing exponentially and this trend is expected to continue. Other planned measures include waste-to-energy and biomass generation plants, wind, distributed and centralized solar PV and capture and use of landfill gas for energy generation.", 
"ii. Electrical energy efficiency: a 22% reduction in electricity consumption compared to a BAU [10] scenario in 2029. Planned measures in this sector include the ‘Public Sector Energy Efficiency and Conservation Programme’, implementation of applicable recommendations through the Caribbean Hotel Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Action-Advanced Program (CHENACT), energy efficiency measures in homes and various LED lighting initiatives.", 
"iii. Non-electrical energy efficiency: a 29% reduction in non-electric energy consumption including transport, compared to a BAU scenario in 2029 [10]. GOB is investing in alternative vehicles and fuels such as compressed natural gas, liquid petroleum gas, ethanol, natural gas, hybrid and electric and encouraging their adoption through tax incentives.", "Waste Sector", "Aside from the energy sector, emissions from waste represent the other main contributor to national GHG emissions (16% in 2008).

"Means of Implementation", "Climate change is a cross-cutting issue that affects every part of the Barbadian economy, social structure and its’ natural environment. In line with its national commitments it is crucial that Barbados continues to build on and strengthen its ambition to achieve the principles behind its sustainable develop policy, in addition to ensuring a low-carbon climate resilient society. In doing so, Barbados looks to regional and international cooperation for support in order to progress the mitigation and adaptation priorities set out in its INDC, that are in line with its national development objectives.", 
"Barbados requires substantial assistance to meet its adaptation objectives set out in its INDC. As a highly vulnerable SIDS, Barbados is already experiencing frequent and major climate change impacts and extreme weather events that could decimate its economy in one extreme (climate related) event. Such impacts will be an ever present threat for the country and will continue to challenge the development of the Barbadian economy as a whole.", "As a SIDS, Barbados will require significant financial, technology transfer and capacity-building support to deliver the intended contribution and related infrastructure. International grant and loan financing mechanisms such as the existing ‘Energy Smart Fund’[20] will be imperative to provide financial and technical support to renewable energy and energy efficiency projects in Barbados. Initial analysis suggests that a number of the planned renewable energy projects (linked to mitigation in the waste sector) in particular, provide a strong economic argument to stimulate private sector investment; however enabling and technology transfer support will still be required. Mitigation actions in the energy efficiency and transport sectors will be largely dependent on international capital financing to implement and to achieve the relative contributions.", 
"Specifically international support will be crucial to the implementation of actions set out in its NCCPF (once formally approved), in addition to its SEF, NAMA and other sectoral policies and plans. The flexibility offered by the existing (i.e. CDM) and future emission reduction mechanisms under the UNFCCC will be used where possible to achieve Barbados’ contribution domestically or jointly with regional/international partners.", "", "",

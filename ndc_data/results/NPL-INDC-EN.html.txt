"Nepal, a least developed mountainous and land-locked country, is one of the least contributors to the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs). With aspirations of the people to improve the country’s economy; its development agenda is constrained given that it is one of the most vulnerable countries to the adverse impact of climate change.", "1. Nepal’s vulnerability to climate change", "Nepal’s mountainous and challenging topography and socio-economic conditions (ranks 145 on the Human Development Index, nearly one-fourth of its population live below poverty line) make it a highly vulnerable country to climate change.", 
"Nepal has experienced changes in temperature and mean precipitation. The country, with the exception of some isolated pockets, has become warmer. Data on trends from 1975 to 2005 showed 0.06°C rise in temperature annually whereas mean rainfall has significantly decreased on an average of 3.7 mm (-3.2%) per month per decade. Under various climate change scenarios for Nepal, mean annual temperatures are projected to increase between 1.3-3.8°C by the 2060s and 1.8-5.8°C by the 2090s. Annual precipitation reduction is projected to be in a range of 10 to 20% across the country.", 
"In Nepal’s Himalaya, total estimated ice reserve between 1977 and 2010 has decreased by 29 percent (129 km3). The number of glacier lakes increased by 11 percent and glaciers recede on an average by 38 km2 per year during the same period. Hence, climate change has visible and pronounced impacts on snows and glaciers that are likely to increase the Glacier Lakes Outburst Floods (GLOFs). Nepal has suffered from the impacts of increased frequency of extreme weather events, such as landslides, floods and droughts resulting in the loss of human lives as well as high social and economic costs.", 
"The 2013 study on Economic Impact Assessment of Climate Change in Key Sectors (agriculture, hydropower and water-induced disasters) has estimated direct cost of current climate variability and extreme events equivalent to 1.5 to 2% of current GDP/year (approximately USD 270-360 million/year in 2013 prices) and much higher in extreme years. In the case of hydropower, the model projected lower dry season flows and thus lower energy availability. The additional energy generation capacity needed to meet future demand under this scenario, due to climate change, was estimated at 2800 MW by 2050 with an increase in costs of USD 2.6 billion (present value) for the period through to 2050. Overall, the economic costs of climate change in Nepal for these three sectors could be equivalent to 2-3% of current GDP/year by mid-century.", 
"Overall, Nepal is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, water-induced disasters and hydro-meteorological extreme events such as droughts, storms, floods, inundation, landslides, debris flow, soil erosion and avalanches. Based on National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) 2010, out of 75 districts, 29 districts are highly vulnerable to natural hazard such as landslides, 22 districts to drought, 12 districts to GLOFs, and 9 districts to flooding.", "Nepal is ranked as the eleventh most earthquake-prone country in the world. It experienced a devastating earthquake of 7.6 magnitudes on 25 April 2015 with around 9,000 casualties and over 22,000 injuries. The destruction was widespread as it ruined houses, heritage sites, schools, health posts, and infrastructures (roads, bridges and hydro-electricity plants) and social systems (water supply, agricultural land, trekking routes, and sports facilities). Lives of about 8 million people have been severely impacted by this earthquake demanding unbelievably high cost of reconstruction.", 
"Earthquake and climate-induced disasters have accelerated vulnerabilities and risks to water, sanitation and food security resulting in further aggravation of country’s vulnerabilities to climatic hazards.", "2. Nepal’s Emission Scenario", "Nepal’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emission is only around 0.027 percent of total global emissions. According to the Second National Communication (2015), GHG emissions from the energy sector is in increasing trend, and this is almost negligible in industry sector. With an agricultural economy, larger portion of GHGs emissions is from the agricultural sector, but the emissions due to increased use of fossil fuels have risen over time. For 1994, total GHGs emission from energy, industrial processes, agriculture and waste (without Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry, LULUCF) was estimated at 29,347 CO2-eq Gg while it has declined to 24,541 CO2-eq Gg for 2000. However, total GHGs emission for 2008 has reached to 30,011 CO2-eq Gg, slightly increased from 1994 emission level. The country as a Party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) pursues and supports efforts to limit temperature rise to well below 2°C leading to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels in order to reduce the risks and adverse impacts of climate change.", 
"Nepal believes that the cumulative impacts of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) submitted to the UNFCCC would greatly contribute to limiting temperature rise to safe levels and making this planet livable. Nepal has prepared its INDC in the process of implementing the decisions of the Conference of the Parties (COPs) through a broad-based stakeholder consultation processes.", "B. NEPAL’S ENHANCED ACTIONS TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE",

More than 25,000 community-based forest management groups across the country are directly engaged in managing about 30% of the country’s total forest area. These community-based organizations are not only contributing to sequestering carbon dioxide by sustainable management of forest resources but also playing effective roles in designing and implementing Community Adaptation Plans of Action (CAPAs) based on forests and non-forests benefits.", 
"Considering climate change mitigation and resilience as one of the major strategic pillars, the Forestry Sector Strategy (2016-2025) aims to enhance Nepal’s forest carbon stock by at least 5% by 2025 as compared to 2015 level, and to decrease mean annual deforestation rate by 0.05% from about 0.44% and 0.18% in the Terai and Siwalik hills respectively. It also aims to put in place forest carbon trade and payment mechanism and mainstream community/ecosystem-based adaptation by 2025.", "Forest areas are planned to be managed in a variety of modalities and regimes including community forests, leasehold forests, collaborative forests and protected areas following a landscape approach to resource conservation and management. The benefits of forests are projected to use in forest-enterprise development, adaptation to climate change and contribution to local and national economy while sustainably conserving watershed and biodiversity.", 
"The Nepal Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (2014-2020) emphasizes biodiversity conservation and ecosystem resilience as keys to national prosperity. The Strategy recognizes legitimate rights of all Nepali people such as indigenous people and local communities, women, Dalits and other disadvantaged social groups over local biological resources.", "c. Energy Policy", "Nepal has a policy for maximum utilization of hydropower potential to meet its domestic demand of electricity by mitigating adverse environmental impacts. It also has a policy to accelerate renewable energy services, and increase access to the Renewable Energy technologies with subsidy provisions.",

This pathway will aid Nepal to bolster social and economic developments and ensure environmental conservation while achieving the goals of sustainable development by reducing poverty.", 
"g. National Adaptation Programme of Action", "As a least developed country Party to the UNFCCC and in accordance with the decisions of the seventh session of the COP held in Marrakesh, Nepal has prepared its National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) to Climate Change in September 2010 through extensive consultative processes to address the most urgent and immediate needs of adaptation. The effective implementation of NAPA priorities would provide multiple opportunities to help climate vulnerable communities and ecosystems to cope with the adverse impacts of climate change, and improve livelihoods by addressing most urgent and immediate adaptation needs.", 
"h. National Framework on Local Adaptation Plan for Action", "In order to localize climate change adaptation, Nepal has adopted a National Framework on Local Adaptation Plan for Action (LAPA) to ensure integration of adaptation and resilience into local to national planning processes. This ensures bottom-up, inclusive, responsive and flexible planning. The LAPA contributes to sensitizing local people and stakeholders, carrying out vulnerability and adaptation assessment; identifying, selecting and prioritizing adaptation options; and formulating and implementing adaptation plans. The framework provides opportunities to develop and implement a stand-alone LAPA and/or integrate adaptation options into the regular planning and implementation processes. At present, Nepal is implementing LAPAs in 90 Village Development Committees and 7 Municipalities - the lowest administrative units in the country. Similarly, about 375 local adaptation plans and nearly 2200 community adaptation plan of action (CAPAs) for community forests have been developed.", 
"i. National Adaptation Plans", "In 2015, Nepal launched a process to formulate and implement National Adaptation Plan (NAP) to address medium and long-term adaptation needs and reduce climate vulnerabilities. This will also promote integration of climate change adaptation into sectoral policies, strategies, plans and programmes. The NAP will be developed through country-driven, extensive consultation, participatory and transparent approaches and concerned ministry-led Thematic Working Groups.", 
"j. Environment Friendly Local Governance Framework", "Nepal is implementing an Environment-Friendly Local Governance (EFLG) Framework with the objectives of mainstreaming environment, climate change adaptation and disaster management in the local planning processes.

"Special National Circumstances", "The Kingdom of Bahrain is an archipelago of low-laying islands, islets, shoals and patches of reefs situated off the central southern coast of the Arabian Gulf. Bahrain has limitations in its size, population and economy which give rise to constraints in financing, technical capacities and options for emission-reduction technology. Bahrain makes relatively minor contributions to global greenhouse gas emissions and mitigation potential will largely depend on national circumstances, capacity and support. Being particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, adaptation is a key priority. Bahrain has no natural surface freshwater resources, scarce and irregular rainfall, minor and dwindling hydrocarbon resources, limited scope in the near term in terms of developing significant alternatives to hydrocarbons-based energy, and an increasingly high population density. As such, a delicate balance must be struck in order for Bahrain to be able to develop sustainably. In addressing economic matters, and as a small island, minimizing the negative impacts of the implementation of response measures with respect to the energy, transport and tourism sectors are of strategic concern.", 
"Intended Nationally Determined Contribution", "Action with mitigation co-benefits", "The Kingdom of Bahrain’s Economic Vision 2030[1] provides the long-term vision for a policy to diversify the economy. The aim is to inter alia reduce Bahrain’s dependence on oil &amp; gas, focusing on the financial, manufacturing and tourism sectors. In line with Decision 24/CP.18, and putting forward current actions and plans in pursuit of economic diversification that have co-benefits in the form of emission reductions, Bahrain’s Vision 2030 maintains that &quot;protecting our natural environment will include conserving our natural spaces for future generations to enjoy; implementing energy-efficiency regulations; directing investments to technologies that reduce carbon emissions, minimize pollution and promote the sourcing of more sustainable energy.&quot;", 
"The following are strategies, plans and actions the Kingdom is undertaking which may contribute to low greenhouse gas emission development:", "", "", "", "Energy Efficiency", "Kingdom of Bahrain Energy Efficiency Programme (KEEP) targets public, residential and commercial buildings and the industrial sector. It aims to improve energy efficiency to reduce cumulative electricity consumption by 2030.  Bahrain Petroleum Company (BAPCO) Energy Conservation Policy promotes the efficient use of natural resources, focusing on four key improvement areas: the improvement of heater efficiency; maximize condensate recovery; reduce mass loss; reactivate on-line energy intensity index. Bahrain National Gas Company (Banagas) has completed a retrofit project of gas turbines which involves replacement of existing high NOx combustion liners resulting in an average reduction of 44% NOx emissions from the power generation station. Tatweer Petroleum efficiency projects include manifold flare projects, associated gas compression projects, oilfield electrification projects and rental compressor stations projects have contributed to the reduction of CO2 emissions. The Motor Vehicles Standards and technical regulations are adopted to reduce the emissions from gasoline and diesel engine vehicles. The Energy Efficient Lighting Initiative project supports replacing energy inefficient ILs with efficient CFLs in the short term and with more efficient technologies such as LED based lamps in the medium term. Civil Aviation Authority - Emission Management Plan for Sustainable Aviation Growth includes an aviation efficiency program. This is developed in response to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) 2010 Assembly Resolution A37-19. Bahrain Airport Company has recently achieved the Airport Carbon Accreditation ‘Level 1 Mapping’ from the Airports Council International (ACI). Ministry of Transportation and Communications continues to find ways and means to mitigate emissions from land transportation.The Kingdom of Bahrain established a unit for Sustainable Energy under the Minster of Energy that focuses on energy conservation and renewable energy Policies.",

The project consists of the installation of 21,000 smart solar panels to generate a substantial number of Kwhs of electricity annually. The Electricity and Water Authority 5MW grid-connected pilot power plant from solar/wind sources is underway.",

The Kingdom of Bahrain has undertaken climate change vulnerability and impact assessments that have addressed four key areas: coastal zones, water resources, human health, and biodiversity.", "Bahrain has no choice but to implement urgent measures to build resilience, improve disaster risk preparedness and response, and adapt to the increasingly adverse impacts of climate change in future. Indeed, there are substantially higher costs associated with adaptation to future impacts of climate change in Bahrain, if actions are initially delayed or ignored. At present, the action being taken to address the issue of adaptation is executed with limited capacities and resources, with a need for a more comprehensive and articulated adaptation package with support from the international community.",

Given the projected future increase in vehicles and traffic, the Ministry of Works, Municipalities and Urban Planning have succeeded in and will continue to reduce traffic time for each vehicle by improving the transportation network. In collaboration with the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, bus routes were created across the country to increase public transport efficiency and attractiveness. Future projects include the GCC Railway Project, and the Bahrain Light Rail Project which may contribute to the reduction of personal vehicle use and emissions.",

The project succeeded in the cultivation of mangroves in Tubli Bay and Doha Arad. There is increasingly strong recognition that there is a need to properly manage particular habitats that act as critical natural carbon sinks. The Black Mangrove is found naturally in Bahrain and is able to sequester carbon and provide an efficient buffer for coastal protection. At present, the Kingdom of Bahrain does not have a full understanding of its mangroves as a carbon sink and is planning to engage with the International Union for Conservation of Nature to do so. Seagrass beds, which constitute an important carbon sink, are distributed along the southeast coast, and along the west coast of Bahrain.

The vision statement overlapped with Lesotho accession into the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Two key strategies were in particular aimed at fulfilling the Vision 2020 pronouncements. The first of these was the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) 2005-2007 which sought to reduce poverty from 56.6% in the base year of 2003 to 29% at the end of the plan period. The second was the National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP):2012-2017 which embraced the key poverty targets of the PRS while seeking to, hence forth, consolidate all development goals with an associated Public Sector Investment Programme for the plan period.", 
"In addition, a number of sector specific policies were adopted pursuant to the aspirations of the NSDP. The Lesotho Energy Policy 2015 envisions that energy shall be universally accessible and affordable in a sustainable manner, with minimal negative impact on the environment and sets goals to reduce in particular fuelwood usage in the national energy consumption including other fossil fuels. The policy further provides for mitigation of climate change, through energy efficiency and promotion of renewable energy. The Draft Strategic Plan for the Ministry of Energy and Meteorology (2015/16 to 2020/21) projects key strategic intentions in both climate change mitigation and adaptation including national energy initiatives. National Rangelands Management Policy 2013 seeks to guide range and natural resources management in the Kingdom. Lesotho has formally committed with support from the European Union, to a process of developing a new National Climate Change Policy and Sustainable Energy Policy.",

Lesotho has a high exposure to climate variability and extremes which are expected to increase in frequency and intensity in the future. A sectoral vulnerability assessment to climate change was carried out on key sectors: agriculture, water resources, forestry, rangelands, and health. Subsequently a National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) was developed in 2007 outlining future adaptation needs to address projected climatic changes.",

"In the 1997/98, GCM simulations of future (2030, 2050 and 2075 relative to 1961-1990) climate change scenarios were generated using an ensemble of six GCMs. More recent climate change simulations show temperatures increasing by about 1 °C by 2030, 1.5-2.0 °C by 2050, and by about 2.5-3.5 °C by the 2080s while winter rainfall shows strong decreases, with no change in summer and autumn rainfall, and gradually increasing spring rainfall (Dejene et al., 2011)2. In summary the following climate change projections appear likely for Lesotho: an increase in annual mean temperature of approximately 1.0 °C (2030), 2.0 °C (2050) and 3.5 °C (2080) is likely; a moderate drying in late autumn/winter is expected and moderate increases in spring/summer rainfall, with stronger spring/summer wetting towards the end of the century.", 
"4.3 Reporting on Long – and Near- Term Adaptation Visions, Goals and Targets ", "Climate change could well undermine national efforts to attain all goals encapsulated in the National Vision 2020 statement and erode achievements that have already been attained over the last few decades, and undermine poverty reduction efforts. Lesotho does not have an officially expressed medium to long term national adaptation plan to climate change. However, our aspirations are expressed explicitly or implicitly in all policy documents, and NSDP. The apparent national adaptation goal (s) towards 2030 embraces all tenets of the MDGs which seek to reduce and /or facilitate national resiliency against climate change shocks especially production decline leading to food insecurity; gender vulnerabilities to climate-change-related impacts especially natural resources e.g. declining quantity and quality of drinking water; environmental degradation; erosion of basic support systems for majority of livelihoods. These are implicit aspects of a long term national adaptation vision to be refined in the national adaptation plan in the pipeline.",

With responsibilities within the household, such as child-rearing, domestic management and meal preparation, women often work longer hours and any added challenges such as those imposed by climate change, will increase their vulnerability and workload. Therefore, climate change adaptation interventions need to include measures to reduce women’s workload.",

According to the latest mapping inventory from 2012, the forested area of Lesotho is estimated to be 49,485 ha, which translates to approximately 1.6% of the country’s area. Lesotho's forests contain 2 million metric tons of carbon in living forest biomass. One of the key objectives of the National Forestry Policy (2008) is to increase tree cover from around 1% to at least 5% (152,000 ha) by the year 2020. However, deforestation rate of 0.50% per year lead to loss of 200 ha between 1990 and 2010. If this trend is reversed, it could potentially produce nearly 38,902 tCO2 of emission reductions for each area of 200 ha of tree cover. These calculations are based on an estimation of the amount of carbon stored in the country’s forests per year to 5tC/ha, and a conversion factor of 1 ton of biomass carbon to an equivalent of 3.67tCO2.", 
"Given, that biomass consumption remains the main source of domestic energy, and energy in small-scale commercial sectors, it will take a radical substitution of household fuel supply. Such a fit would also require significant financial support to Lesotho towards to subsidize fuel-efficient cook stoves, and alternative fuels and techniques for cooking, which altogether might have a significant impact on GHG emissions. The cost of reforestation option would amount to USD 24 million between 2015 and 2030 for the 120,000 ha of land to be reforested with an initial establishment cost of USD 200/ha.

"5.6 Sectors ", "The SNC shows that three major sectors account for the emissions burden of the country. These are Energy (including transportation), Agriculture and Waste sector. However, in the SNC, emissions from forestry and other land uses, as well as in industrial processes have not been analysed since they have a relatively insignificant share in total GHG emissions. However, the in the future these will be monitored and analysed to establish the emerging trends with time.",

Carbon Dioxide accounts for the least emissions with 23% of the total emissions. Emissions of GHGs not listed are negligible but will still be monitored and reported. Fluorinated gases are not covered since they are rarely used and their emissions are marginal.", "5.8 Accounting Methodologies ", 
"GHG inventories based on IPCC guidelines and methodologies will remain the foundation of emissions accounting in the context of the UNFCCC. They are currently reported and included in the national communications. In future they will be reported and included in the biannual update reports. Lesotho considers the establishment of an international market mechanism vital to reduce the total costs to achieve the target of limiting the temperature increase to 2°C. Thus the country remains open to the possibility of using of international market-based mechanisms in line with agreed accounting rules to achieve its conditional and/or unconditional targets. Reporting of GHG inventories and updates on mitigation actions and goals via national communications, as well as verification of this information via in-depth reviews, international assessment and review and international consultations Biennial updates to GHG inventory and reporting on mitigation actions will also be developed as part of the Climate Change Policy and Response Strategy.",

In addition, LMS is the focal point in the planning and co-ordination of activities for Lesotho’s commitments under the UNFCCC. A National Climate Change Committee (NCCC) was formally established in 2013 to effectively coordinate climate change issues in the country. The committee serves as an advisory body to the LMS.", 
"The INDC report was informed by a broad representation of experts and stakeholder institutions in a national launching workshop. Subsequently, the respective experts consulted broadly across governmental and non-governmental stakeholder institutions and expert informants. The draft mitigation and adaptation reports were subjected to a one day validation workshop prior to consolidation by the Lead Expert. The final summary report to the UNFCCC was endorsed by national stakeholders in a validation workshop and reviewed by an appointed international institution. Subsequently the report was presented for endorsement by a relevant sub-committee of the National Assembly.", 
"5.10 Equity and Fairness ", "Lesotho’s INDC is an ambitious, fair and responsible contribution to global efforts toward meeting the objective of the UNFCCC with the goal of limiting global average temperature rise to below 2°C. Lesotho’ proposed targets are ambitious, despite its status as a very vulnerable, small, landlocked least developed country with a fragile mountainous ecosystem and numerous pressing social and economic development needs and priorities. We submit that these nationally intended contributions are fair and equitable commensurate to the national circumstances especially its low GDP per capita (≈ US$1,126) and the level of dependence on external support. Though Lesotho’s GHG emissions represent only 0.005% of global emissions and net per capita emissions, inclusive of all sectors, are 1.1 tCO2e, it is highly vulnerable to climate change, particularly in the agriculture, energy and water sectors and has already experienced extreme weather shifts. Nevertheless, Lesotho is a responsible party committed to tackling global climate change by transforming its development route to a low emissions pathway, which requires progressive decoupling of carbon emissions from economic growth.",

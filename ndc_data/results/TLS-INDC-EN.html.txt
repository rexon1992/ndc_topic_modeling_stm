"Based on Timor Leste's Initial National Communication 2014, 44.7% of the sucos (villages) in Timor-Leste could be categorized as quite vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, 2.9 % vulnerable and 11.5 % very vulnerable. Thus only 18.6% sucos were less or not vulnerable. The vulnerable sucos are mostly located in the western part of the country21. The impact of climate change is expected to be high in the vulnerable sucos and therefore, these sucos should be the highest priority for the implementation of adaptation actions. Improving the capacity of the sucos to manage climate risk in key sectors such as agriculture and water is very important as part of the effort to reduce their vulnerability. Losses in agricultural production due to climate change will increase poverty within the sucos and this in turn will contribute to an increase in their vulnerability. Therefore, assessment of climate change impacts on key sectors is crucial to assist in identifying adaptation options.", 
"Based on the trends of sea level obtained from satellite altimetry data (referred to as multi-mission), there were increasing trends of sea level rise surrounding Timor-Leste. The rate of SLR was found to be higher in the south coast (≥5.5 mm/year) than in the north (&lt;5.5 mm/year) as reported in the initial National Communication, 2014. On average, the rate of sea level rise surrounding the main island of the country based on multi-mission satellite altimetry is around 5.5 mm/year. Assuming that this rate is linearly consistent to the future (2010-2100), the sea level in the region is projected to increase abound 50 mm by 2100.22", 
"4.2 Adaptation Measures", "The 'Dii Declaration on Climate Change Adaptation' recognized &quot;the strong interdependence of Climate Change Adaptation and the development targets of Timor-Leste as outlined in the strategic development plan. We believe thot the government's priorities for the people of Timor-Leste can only be sustainably achieved when we consider effective Climate Change Adaptation a pre-condition. Hence, we commit to the mainstreaming of climate change adaptation in the action plans in all sectors to work jointly towards the targets outlined in the national policies. We reiterate the commitments to ail International declarations signed by Timor-Leste regarding sustainable development and climate change, including internationally agreed development goals&quot;.", 
"Adaptation measures need to focus on reducing the adverse effects of climate change, promote sustainable development and reduce poverty. These measures should build on existing strategies and plans across all sectors within Timor-Leste including the National Priorities process.

"5. Loss and Damage", "This is a vital issue for Timor-Leste which it would like to actively pursue as part of the mandate for a review of the structure and plans at COP22. It would also like to enhance understanding, actions and support or, areas including comprehensive risk assessment and management; risk insurance and risk transfer; rehabilitation; early warning systems; emergency preparedness; stow onset events; risk insurance facilities like crop insurance; events involving permanent end irreversible loss and damage; non-economic lasses; and resilience of communities, livelihoods and ecosystems.", 
"6. Implementation of the INDC", "6.1 Planning process for Producing the INDC", "Timor-Leste adopted an all-inclusive process of engaging relevant stakeholders through bilateral consultations and workshops. The post COP21 Dialogue held in Dili provided much needed awareness about INDCs and the provision of additional data and information. It strengthened the whole-of-government approach by providing national ownership of the INDC, as well as helped realise the synergies between other processes, including Initial National Communication, National Adaptation Programme of Action25 (2010), Strategic Plan for the Ministry of Finance (2011-2030), Rural Energy Policy (2008), National Strategic Development Plan (2011-2030) and other externally funded development projects in related areas.", 
"A national stakeholder consultation was held to solicit inputs of data and other relevant Information based on an initial draft of the INDC that was circulated earlier. This consultation included representation from a wide range of stakeholders, including government, non-governmental, private sector and development partner representatives. Key informant Interviews were conducted with relevant key stakeholders to collect and validate relevant data and sources.", "The national workshop was followed by two more focus group consultations with relevant stakeholders from different GoTL ministries and directorates, organised in conjunction with the National Directorate of Climate Change, the national Climate Change Working Group and UNDP to review and finalize the INDC draft.", 
"7. Means of Implementation", "“The most vulnerable are those with limited financial, technological and human capacities to adapt to the impacts of climate change. This leads to Food insecurity, famine, destruction of infrastructure, human displacement and further poverty in developing countries, especially in the “Least Developed Countries”, with limited capacity on adaptation&quot;, H. E. J. Ramos-Horta, former Head of State, The Special Envoy of the President of Timor-Leste, 1996 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate26.", 
"As an LDC, the ability of Timor Leste to pursue the proposed adaptation and mitigation act ons identified in this INDC will be dependent upon the receipt of technology transfer, finance and capacity building support, As Identified throughout this document, Timor-Leste is already undertaking programmes with the support of multilateral development banks, international agencies and developed countries. This is welcomed. However, further support will be required for meaningful implementation.", 
"7.1 Financial", "Lack of funds is the main obstacle to development and implementation of actions that may assist in climate change mitigation and adaptation. The funding issue is also major impediment to national research and development efforts, as well as to building human and institutional capacity.", "Timor-Leste will need international financial assistance for adaptation and mitigation actions that is predictable and sustained for the duration of the programmes Timor-Leste welcomes the ability to access finance through the Green Climate Fund (GCF), and has already started working with the GCF on implementing its readiness proposal and the development of pipeline of projects. Timor-Leste looks forward to streamlined modalities of the global climate change funds including the GCF to facilitate efficient access of funds for its adaptation and mitigation efforts. It will pursue efforts to get accreditation as National Implementing Entity while working with international accredited entities to develop relevant projects for the GCF pipeline, as well as through the GEF funding windows under the Adaptation Fund (AF) and Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF).", 
"The GoTL would work with development partners and multilateral agencies to ensure inclusive development based on its identified priorities, and aims to promote coherence and greater coordination amongst donors for greater effectiveness of implementation. The issue of climate change is a development challenge for Timor-Leste and cuts across all the SDGs, the implementation of which would be a key priority for the country in coming years, Timor- Leste will emphasize country ownership of these climate resilient development interventions using country processes that are led by the country.", 
"Additional funding must be allocated at a scale sufficient to meet the significant gap between what is needed and the level of funding already pledged by development partners during negotiations under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Funding needs to be tracked and reported on transparently. Small Island Developing States (SIDS) including Timor-Leste must be assisted with readiness support to build capacity, implement climate plans and strengthen climate finance management. Access to the complex array of climate finance mechanisms must be simplified. SIDS communities must receive direct support to be actively engaged in building climate resilience.", 
"If Timor-Leste choses to ratify the Paris Agreement, it will be able to access funds through the Green Climate Fund (GCF)", "Technological", "A preliminary survey of Environmentally Sound Technology (EST) and the status of Research and Systematic Observation was carried out as part of the preparation of the Initial National Communication in 2013. According to that survey, the technologies that have been implemented to date in Timor-Leste include biogas, organic agriculture, efficient cook stoves, agro-forestry and rainfall harvesting. Technologies on organic agriculture, agro­forestry, rainfall harvesting, recycling of agricultural waste, biogas, efficient cookstoves and water conservation were perceived as being the most important technologies for further development27 (INC, 2014). Renewable energy is also viewed as an area for further development.", 
"7.2 Capacity Building", "Institutional and capacity development for staff and community should be continuously assessed, challenged and improved to make the greatest impact on the country by assisting all stakeholders. A combination of a variety of mechanisms, from various data collections and verification workshops to informal brainstorming with stakeholders should be utilized for this purpose.", "Capacity development is a long term process. A single development agency cannot provide comprehensive support, and concerted efforts by the government and the international community are therefore crucial. The three pillar model, which addresses skills and knowledge, systems and processes, and attitudes and behaviours, could be used as a starting point to develop a comprehensive institutional capacity development plan", 
"Some of the specific measures as part of the National Institutional Capacity Development for Climate Change include:", "", "Strengthening the mandate of the cross-sectoral national climate change team to improve coordination and engagement,", "Capacity development support for key non-governmental institutions in low emissions and climate resilient development planning, including national NGOs and research/educational institutions,", "Development of a national climate change strategy and action plan.", 
"Promotion of sub-national capacity development for Improved adaptation planning and implementation.", "Strengthening national hydro-meteorological department to collect, compile, analyze and disseminate climate-related data.", "", "7.3 Fair and Ambitious ", "The Republic of Timor-Leste is a small contributor to the greenhouse gas emissions by any measurable indicator and yet it is at the frontline of the wrath of climate change and sea level rise. It has a right to develop its economy and improve the well-being of its population. Limiting the global temperature to below 2°C relative to preindustrial levels, and pursue efforts to limit it below 1.5°C provides a moral Imperative for Timor-Leste. The government has embarked on a number of actions which will result in increasing the use of renewable energy technologies, improve energy security and reduction of GHG emissions. However, the main focus for long term sustainable development still remains adaptation to climate change by addressing the adverse impacts of climate change Timor-Leste has been at the forefront of responding to climate change as a Party to the UNFCCC through actions taken at the national level, as outlined in section 2.2.", 
"8. Conclusion", "Timor-Leste is already experiencing the adverse effects of climate change and recognizes that it will seriously undermine efforts towards resilience building, sustainable development and eradicating poverty.", "Climate change is a cross-cutting development issue as it affects every aspect of the Timorese way of life and livelihoods Climate change impacts exacerbate existing cultural and socio-economic vulnerabilities. These impacts threaten the sustainable development of the nation. To this end. the people of Timor baste must collectively build and strengthen the nation's resilience to combat climate change, However, this cannot be done alone and in isolation; regional and global cooperation is imperative to put the country on a pathway to climate change resilience and sustainable development", 
"Timor-Leste's vulnerabilities studies and modelling of future climate demonstrates that the scientific underpinnings of the discussions on climate change are clear in defining impact thresholds. Therefore, international cooperation and support is required to assist it pursue a sustainable development pathway.", "Timor-Leste continues to revise its policies in energy and climate change sectors in line with its sustainable development as contained in the Strategic Development Plan. The significant costs of imported fossil fuels are a major factor in its balance of payments. Whilst Timor-Leste continues to take actions to reduce its fossil fuel import bill, thereby reducing its carbon footprint, it will underscore the need for support to assist in its ambition for transforming the energy sector to low-carbon sources through greater use of renewables such as solar and wind and use of transformational technology.", 
"Timor-Leste's INDC makes no attempt to set a target for reducing emissions. This is deliberate as Timor-Leste does not feel that as a LDC, its target serves any meaningful purpose in the overall context of global emissions Notwithstanding this Timor-Leste has already undertaken thorough renewable energy programs to provide alternative energy sources such as solar home lighting systems to primarily rural population. Moreover, through programs such as efficient cookstoves, it will have significant impact on the use of biomass resources and forest/land degradation sectors. There are many opportunities to push through other measures such as conservation, education and energy efficiency and other measures, recognizing its extreme vulnerability to the impacts of fossil fuel prices.", 
"International support is crucially important to enable Timor-Leste implement further actions enshrined in its policies and plans, in both mitigation and adaptation, at sectoral levels. For example, the growing emissions in the transport sector, as evidenced from the increased numbers of vehicles on land and vessels for sea transport, needs to be addressed through technological innovations like replacement of ODS alternatives through energy efficient, low polluting and warming potential substances in air-conditioning and refrigeration.", 
"This INDC will be a strong basis for Timor-Leste's NDC envisaged under the Paris Agreement. Full and thorough consultations with all stakeholders and within Government will be undertaken prior to ratification of the Paris Agreement.", "", "", "", "Tmor-Leste in Figures, Ministry of Finance, 2014↩", "General Directorate of Statistics, Ministry of Finance, 2016↩",

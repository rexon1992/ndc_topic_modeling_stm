Introduction ", "In preparing and submitting its INDC, Ghana is mindful of its international obligations as a Party to the UNFCCC while simultaneously pursuing a national development agenda that seeks to achieve the long-standing objective of becoming a fully-fledged middle-income economy. Ghana’s response to the threats posed to this objective by the impacts of climate change has been to pursue coordinated domestic policy actions that in effect seek to develop a policy framework that integrates adaptation, mitigation and other climate related policies within broader development policies and planning in order to safeguard developmental gains from the impacts of climate change and build a climate resilient economy.", 
"At the multilateral level, Ghana reaffirms its resolve to support global efforts to define a common future that seeks to safeguard the collective interest of all nations by supporting a global agreement that is fair, ambitious and balanced, respects the right of nations to pursue sustainable development, and above all gives equal opportunities to all nations and their citizens, to pursue and realise their future aspirations.", "At the milestone 17th Session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) held in Durban, South Africa in December 2011, the Parties decided to “develop a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to all Parties” for adoption at the twenty-first session of the COP and for it to come into effect and be implemented from 2020. Parties agreed that their work will address inter alia, mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, transparency of action and support, and capacity building.", 
"At COP 19 in Warsaw, Parties agreed to advance their work by focusing on the elements of the new agreement. The Warsaw Conference was also very significant in that for the first time in Decision 1/CP 19, Parties were invited to “initiate or intensify domestic preparations for their intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs), without prejudice to the legal nature of the contributions”. The decision also requested the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action to identify by the 20th session of the COP, the information that Parties will provide when putting forward their contributions, without prejudice to the legal nature of the contributions. Ghana holds the view that the INDCs should cover mitigation, adaptation, finance technology, capacity building and transparency and agrees with the common position of Africa that:",

These include the National Communications, Biennial Update Reports, Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) and Technology Needs Assessment (TNAs). Ghana sees finance as an essential part of the whole INDC process. The scope of finance from the developed countries must address mitigation, adaptation, and technology transfer and development in developing countries. It should not be solely focused on mitigation.", 
"Ghana as a Party to the UNFCCC and also to the Kyoto Protocol is committed to meeting its commitments in order to contribute its fair share to the attainment of the objective of the Convention. In view of this and in accordance with Decisions 1/CP.19 and 1/CP.20, the Republic of Ghana is pleased to communicate its INDC and associated explanatory note to facilitate the clarity, transparency, and understanding of our contribution.", "2.

In all, 20 mitigation and 11 adaptation programme of actions1 in 7 priority economic sectors are being proposed for implementation in the 10year period (2020-2030).

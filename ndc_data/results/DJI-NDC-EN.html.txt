The process of drafting the INDC enabled a summary of all of the policies and programmes linked to climate change. It also provided an opportunity to reassess financing needs to fund the country’s adaptation.", 
"As an LDC and a coastal country of the Horn of Africa, the country’s vulnerability is considerably high.", "As a result, this contribution reflects both the country’s political will to participate in the worldwide reduction of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and the scope of its adaptation needs.", "The Republic of Djibouti has committed to reducing its GHG emissions by 40% by the year 2030, representing close to 2 Mt of CO2e, compared to projections for that year according to the businessas-usual scenario. This commitment is an ambitious one for a country like the Republic of Djibouti. It can be attained through a combination of mitigation measures and the development of sustainable economic sectors like renewable energies.", 
"To fulfil that level of ambition, the Republic of Djibouti will need to invest more than US $3.8 billion, in collaboration with the international community. An additional US $1.6 billion, conditional on new funding sources like the Green Climate Fund, along with international support, would enable the country to reduce its emissions by a further 20% by 2030. The total effort, under both the unconditional and conditional scenarios, would essentially entail maintaining the country’s emissions at roughly their level in 2010.",

However, that sum represents just 12% of the total amount that will need to be invested in adaptation under the 2°C Scenario, and a mere 7.5% in the case of the 4°C Scenario.", 
"These figures show that investing in adaptation measures is a crucial issue for the Republic of Djibouti. The country will not be able to raise the necessary funds on its own.

The country has a semi-desert tropical climate characterised by recurring natural catastrophes and extended periods of drought. Its arable land, natural and mineral resources, and water resources are very low and are subject to strong pressure from climate change. With an estimated per capita gross national product (GNP) of US $1,030 in 2014, the Republic of Djibouti is one of the poorest countries in the world, and one of the most vulnerable to climate change.", 
"At COP19 in Warsaw, the Republic of Djibouti underscored the fact that climate change is a threat to the country’s food security and water resources, as well as to sustainable development. With its arid climate and low level of social development, the Republic of Djibouti is vulnerable to various climate-related effects, including extreme drought, extreme temperatures, rising sea levels, flash floods and the salinization of soils and water. These phenomena have already been observed in the country and are expected to increase in frequency and intensity in the future, according to the various climate scenarios.", 
"In the case of an optimistic climate scenario, the cost of the damage is likely to exceed US $5 billion. Implementing adaptation measures would make it possible to anticipate the effects of climate change.

To achieve that aim, several political plans are under development, including national strategies for a green economy, for biodiversity and on climate change.", "The Republic of Djibouti will work to contribute to global efforts to reduce GHG emissions. This ambition will rely on the development of renewable energies such as geothermal, wind and solar power.

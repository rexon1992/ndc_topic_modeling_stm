Cabo Verde solid waste management has traditionally been organized around its 22 municipalities with most of the solid waste - around 113,000 tonnes per year in 2010 - still going directly into open dumps, with the exception of the city of Praia which currently operates a sanitary landfill.

The lack of arable lands (only about 10% of the land is potentially arable) forces the country to import between 80% and 90% of its food needs. In addition, the country´s coastal lines are particularly vulnerable to sea level rise and erosion. Around 80% of its population is currently living in these coastal areas. Cabo Verde´s coastal zones are also crucial to foster and sustain the local tourism industry, the main driving force behind the country´s service-oriented economy.", 
"Climatic models ran during the NAPA assessment for the period 2008-2012 have shown that the country´s natural vulnerabilities, along with their social and economic implications, are very likely to be exacerbated by climate-related disruptions in the next decades. These include more frequent extreme events like storms, floods and droughts, as well as shorter rainy seasons, with immediate impacts on livelihoods, infrastructure, sanitary conditions, recharge of reservoirs, and crop productivity.", 
"Cabo Verde is affected by acute water scarcity (both surface and underground). Mean annual precipitation levels are erratic and have decreased considerably since 1970. Rainfall projections to 2020 reveal values below the historical pattern. As result, the country has implemented and regularly maintains around 20 highly costly and energy- intensive water desalination units. Daily water needs of population centres, tourism and agriculture is predicted to increase fourfold, from around 50,000m3 to 160,000m3 by 2030 and thus the potential of various sustainable water supply and mobilization solutions will need to be better explored going forward.",

The National Context ", "St. Vincent and the Grenadines is a multi-island nation consisting of 32 islands each with its own characteristics. It is located in the Eastern Caribbean and has a population of approximately 110,000. St. Vincent is the largest of the 32 islands that comprise the nation, covering roughly 390 sq. km (150 sq. miles). The Grenadines extend 72 km (45 miles) to the southwest. The other inhabited islands, north to south, are Young Island, Bequia, Mustique, Canouan, Mayreau, Union Island, Palm Island, and Petit St. Vincent. The Government of St. Vincent and the Grenadines (GoSVG) ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1996 and the Kyoto Protocol in 2004. This INDC represents St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ intention and has no legal status. Any form of commitment is yet to be decided, pending the outcomes of the 21st Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC in Paris in December 2015.", 
"The geography, geology and socio-economic circumstances of St. Vincent and the Grenadines make it extremely vulnerable to climate-related natural disasters. Due to its mountainous topography, most activities on the mainland are concentrated on the narrow, low-lying coast line, at risk to sea-level rise (SLR) and coastal erosion while the landscape also adds risks of landslides and flash flooding. An increase in severe weather events will result in significant expenditures, which will further constrain St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ social and economic growth.", 
"St. Vincent and the Grenadines have suffered significant impacts over the past five years (2010 to 20141) as a result of severe weather events. In total, the loss to the country was in excess of US$600 million2 over that period, equating to approximately 35% of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP). With per capita GDP amongst the lowest in the Caribbean3, severe weather events caused by anthropogenic climate change will fundamentally restrict economic development. The increased coastal erosion, droughts, storms, floods and landslides of the last decade have severely impacted livelihoods and government have neither the financial or technical resources to address these challenges.", 
"Climate projections for St. Vincent and the Grenadines suggest an increase in average atmospheric temperature; reduced average annual rainfall; increased Sea Surface Temperatures (SST); and the potential for an increase in the intensity of tropical storms4. There is currently no monitoring of sea level around St. Vincent and the Grenadines; however observations from tidal gauges surrounding the Caribbean basin indicate that SLR in the Caribbean is broadly consistent with the global trend.", 
"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in their 5th Assessment Report, states the following projected changes over 2081–2100 (relative to 1986–2005) for the Caribbean for an intermediate low-emissions scenario:", "", "a decrease in average annual rainfall of about 5–6%;", "a 1.2°C to 2.3°C median annual increase in surface temperature; and", "sea level rise projections in the region of 0.5 m to 0.6 m5.",

As well as developing a national Energy Action Plan, there is a comprehensive Mitigation Assessment in the forthcoming Second National Communication. The largest contributor to reducing emissions will be the installation of a geothermal electricity generation facility, which when operational will provide over 50% of the country’s electricity needs. Further to this, initiatives are underway to improve energy efficiency in buildings and transport as well as reduce emissions from waste going to landfill.", 
"St. Vincent and the Grenadines would like to express its support for the Republic of China (Taiwan) which has completed its own INDC despite not being a Party to the UNFCCC. Taiwan has committed to reduce its GHG emissions by 50 percent compared to its business-as-usual scenario by 2030 (20% lower than 2005).

The following sections explain the strategies and measures which will be undertaken to deliver the contribution.", "The energy sector accounted for approximately 68% of St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ GHG emissions in 20108 with projected further growth through to 2025, and is therefore the focus of its mitigation activity. Within the sector, approximately 50% of emissions can be attributed to energy generation and approximately 50% from transport. The following subsector mitigation contributions have been identified:", 
"", "Renewable energy: the plans for renewable energy generation are focused on the development of the country’s proposed geothermal power plant (planned to be completed in 2018). The facility, when complete, will generate approximately 50% of the national annual electricity consumption needs. In addition to the geothermal plant, the national energy utility is renovating existing hydro power facilities to improve efficiency and generation capacity as well as enabling and encouraging the installation of small-scale photovoltaics (PV) in the private and public sectors.", 
"Energy efficiency: there is an objective to achieve a 15% reduction in national electricity consumption9 compared to a BAU scenario by 2025. Planned measures in this sector include the retrofitting of street lighting nationally, a new building code and an energy labelling scheme for appliances.", "Transport: new policies to reduce the import duty paid on low emission vehicles are in the process of being introduced to encourage their use. It is estimated that this will result in avoided emissions of approximately 10% over the next 10 years10.", 
"Significant potential for greater reductions (e.g. improved public transport) is achievable if international finance can be made available, however this needs further analysis to quantify the reduction potential and support required and consequently these measures have not been included in the economy-wide contribution at this stage. Currently, transport is the fastest growing source of emissions and reductions from this sector will be largely dependent on international financial support and technology transfer.", 
"Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF): St. Vincent and the Grenadines intends to develop its GHG sinks though reforestation, afforestation reduced deforestation and reduced forest degradation. At this stage, good quality data does not exist for the forestry inventory, however this is in the process of being addressed. Once the forestry inventory is compiled, policies and actions will be developed for the sector, however the related contribution is not quantifiable at this stage.

"In particular, Goal 4 of the Plan; ‘Improving Physical Infrastructure, Preserving the Environment and Building Resilience to Climate Change’ seeks to ensure that St. Vincent and the Grenadines develops its physical infrastructure, while preserving the country’s delicate environment, as well as mitigating the effects of climate change. To reduce the adverse impacts of climate change, the Plan proposes several adaptation measures to reduce future restoration costs and to protect the natural environment. Public education and awareness of the potential negative effects of climate change are at the forefront of this Plan16. The proposed strategic interventions include:",

"", "4.2 Existing vulnerabilities in the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors ", "Agriculture is one of the largest economic activities on St. Vincent and it contributes significantly to the economic and social development of rural livelihoods in particular. Offshore fisheries are also important and are predominately small scale and artisanal. Tourism activities are concentrated in the Grenadines islands and all other livelihood activities in these islands are inherently linked to tourism. Such livelihoods are vulnerable to climate change impacts, as they are heavily dependent on the stability of the climate conditions or natural resources.", 
"The agriculture sector in St. Vincent is especially sensitive to extended periods of drought, unevenly distributed rainfall and natural disasters when coupled with existing practices such as mono-cropping and poor soil and water management. Three extreme climatic events over a span of three years (2009 – 2011 inclusive) highlighted the vulnerability in this sector.", "", "In 2009 there was a water shortage resulting from drought conditions. Many residents in Georgetown practise agriculture and farmers suffered losses from reduced crop production that year. As a consequence, food prices rose and produce had to be imported from other islands to supplement the limited supply in St. Vincent.", 
"In 2010 hurricane Tomas resulted in losses totalling EC $35 million, mainly to banana and plantain production.", "During the second week of April 2011 heavy rainfall caused rivers to overflow and landslides in the north-eastern section of St. Vincent in a major agricultural area. This occurred while the sector was still recovering from damages caused by hurricane Tomas in the previous year.", "", "4.3 Existing vulnerabilities in the tourism sector ", 
"Expected increases in the frequency or magnitude of certain weather and climate extremes (e.g. heat waves, droughts, floods, tropical cyclones) as a result of climate change will affect the tourism industry through increased infrastructure damage, additional emergency preparedness requirements, higher operating expenses (e.g. insurance, backup water and power systems and evacuations) and business interruptions.", "Results from the SLR modelling work conducted in 2011 indicate that 1 metre SLR places 10% of the major tourism properties at risk, along with 1% of road networks, 50% of airports and 67% of sea ports. Engineered structures and natural environments (e.g. mangroves) can protect against some of these impacts to coastal regions, but the dynamics of these erosion processes will demand some adaptation of coastal infrastructure and settlements18.", 
"4.4 Existing vulnerabilities in the coastal zone ", "More than 90% of the infrastructural development of St. Vincent and the Grenadines lies on a narrow coastal belt less than eight meters above sea-level. These include the island’s main communication and emergency response structures - roads, airports, telecommunication, financial, and technical support centres19. Additionally, many of the coastal protection ecosystems such as dunes, mangroves and reefs have been removed or are degraded, which exacerbate vulnerability of coastal infrastructure to storm and hurricane activity (particularly wind and storm surges).", 
"4.5 Existing vulnerabilities in the water resources sector ", "Watersheds have also been affected by land degradation due to “squatting, mono-cropping with poor agricultural techniques, global weather patterns (changes in rainfall distribution, drought and elevated atmospheric temperatures), deforestation and excessive use of agrochemicals”20.", 
"Climate models suggest that the country will experience drying throughout the year (even during the wet season). Further reduced rainfall would severely impact the water supply of rivers and streams in St. Vincent and is of particular concern for the Grenadine islands which have a very high dependence on rainwater for freshwater supply. An increase in the intensity of rainfall in fewer rain days is also expected, which means that not only is the country vulnerable to droughts, but also to the secondary effects of torrential rains such as landslides and the contamination of water supplies.", 
"4.6 Existing vulnerabilities in the health sector ", "Vector borne diseases may increase due to increased precipitation and temperatures in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. In the St. Vincent and the Grenadines Strategic Plan For Health 2007 – 2012 it was stated that “National household and Breteaux indices continue to be above and beyond internationally accepted levels”. Dengue is specifically mentioned21 but malaria cases have also been reported. Data obtained from the Ministry of Health reported one imported case of malaria in 2008 and another in 2010.

"Elements of the INDC are already enshrined in the national agenda through the existing ‘National Social and Economic Development Plan 2013-2025’ (Strategic Goal 4), which addresses the strategic necessity to adapt to the changing climate to protect its delicate environment while reducing GHG emissions. The ‘National Physical Development Plan’ also references the importance of energy efficiency in buildings and transport. The national electricity utility provider, VINLEC, has also established a feed-in-tariff to encourage the installation of distributed PV.", 
"Whilst the report has been prepared as partial fulfillment of the country’s obligations to the UNFCCC, there are many domestic benefits of developing and implementing an INDC. St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ INDC clearly demonstrates its political commitment and help realize non-climate benefits that support developmental priorities, in particular, reduced spending on imported fossil fuels. Additionally, these actions are consistent with the strategies and programmes identified in the Climate Change and the Caribbean: A Regional Framework for Achieving Development Resilient to Climate Change endorsed by the CARICOM Heads of State.", 
"7. Means of Implementation ", "St. Vincent and the Grenadines has shown its commitment to mitigating climate change by independently taking concrete measures to reduce its emissions, particularly through renewable energy and waste initiatives30. It is hoped that this commitment and ambition will be recognised by the international community as progressive (in the context of the country’s SIDS status) and that it will enable the country to leverage international finance (through the Green Climate Fund for example), technology transfer and capacity-building support to help further reduce emissions, especially in the areas of transport, renewable energy and energy efficiency.", 
"In particular, St. Vincent and the Grenadines would welcome financial and capacity-building support to help produce a Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action (NAMA) for the country’s transport sector. This is a key priority if national GHG emissions are to be stabilised and reduced over the coming years. Similar international support in capacitybuilding and finance for the LULUCF sector is also sought to help establish a related programme of mitigation actions.", "Despite the injection of funds to the country through the PPCR, the need for financing climate change adaptation and mitigation in St. Vincent and the Grenadines remains significant. This is especially so considering the extent of vulnerabilities and the percentage of the population potentially exposed. Devastating losses already being experienced and projected climate change impacts suggest that mobilizing additional, adequate and timely financing is vital to the country’s socio-economic development.",

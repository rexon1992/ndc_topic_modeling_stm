The region of South East Europe, including Montenegro, is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change thus avoiding dangerous climate change is of paramount importance for the country.", 
"Montenegro is a non-Annex I country with a population of 621 200. According to 2013 data GDP per capita is 5 356 EUR. Size of country causes reduced flexibility in the application of policies in some emitting sectors where single source of emissions can be dominant, distorting the emission profile of the country. Also, it should be noted that tourism is one of the main drivers of the economy, having the number of tourists visiting the country annually more than twice of the number of local population.", 
"Montenegro’s contribution to the international effort to avoid dangerous climate change is expressed in 30 % emission reduction by 2030 compared to the 1990 base year. The emission level of greenhouse gases for Montenegro from sectors covered by INDC was 5239 kilotons in 1990 and Montenegro pledges to reduce it at least by 1572 kilotons, to the level below or at 3667 kilotons. The reduction is to be achieved by general increase of energy efficiency, improvement of industrial technologies, increase of the share of renewables and modernization in the power sector.",

The scenarios for the INDC were developed in consultation with the authors of the National Climate Change Strategy of Montenegro. Within the preparation process of the INDC it became clear that significant data uncertainty exist regarding the emissions and removal in the land use, land use change and forestry sectors.", 
"Participation in international market mechanism", "Montenegro intends to sell carbon credits during the period to contribute towards achieving its emission reduction objectives as assistance to cost-effective implementation of the low emission development pathway. Montenegro foresees that for the utilization of international market mechanism is conditional on having effective accounting rules developed under the UNFCCC to ensure the environmental integrity of the mechanisms.", 
"Fairness, equity, ambition and Means of Implementation", "Fairness, equity and ambition", "Montenegro is a non-Annex I country, highly vulnerable to the effects of the climate change. National emissions of the greenhouse gases represent only 0,009 % of global emissions and the net per capita GHG emissions in Montenegro was 7.25 tCO2eq in 2010. Montenegro will take into account the ultimate objective of the UNFCCC in its future development and will be committed to decouple greenhouse gas emissions from its economic growth and embarks on a low emission development pathway. The INDC submitted by Montenegro is fair and ambitious because it aims to secure significant reduction of its greenhouse gas emissions while satisfies the country’s need for economic development, allowing a feasible pathway for long-term decarbonisation.", 
"Means of implementation", "The National Climate Change Strategy will be the main planning tool along with its action plans for the implementation of Montenegro’s intended nationally determined contribution until 2030. The Energy Development Strategy of Montenegro by 2030 also takes into consideration climate change as one of its six objectives and the INDC is developed in line with the trends foreseen for the energy sector development of Montenegro. Montenegro is in the process of accession to the European Union which involves the gradual transposition and implementation of the European Union’s climate and energy legislation.",

Improved inventory data was used to the INDC and also for the Biennial Update Report of Montenegro compared to the 2nd National Communication.", 
"Approach to accounting for agriculture, forestry and other land uses", "Greenhouse gas emissions and removals from agriculture, forestry and other land uses are currently not included in the accounting. Emissions and removals from these sectors can be included in the INDC at a later stage when technical conditions allow for that.", "Having relatively high uncertainty regarding emissions in the LULUCF sector Montenegro reserves its right to review its INDC until 2020 upon the availably of more accurate data and improved technical conditions regarding land use, land use change and forestry and include it in its nationally determined contribution.", 
"If the agreement or related COP decisions are amended before their entry into force in such a way that they include rules or provisions that significantly affect the assumptions under which this INDC has been developed, Montenegro reserves the right to revisit the INDC.", "Montenegro requests the UNFCCC Secretariat that this submission is published on the UNFCCC webpage and that our INDC is included in the synthesis report to be prepared by the Secretariat.", "", "")

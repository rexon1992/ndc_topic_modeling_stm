Although Morocco is responsible for only a small share of the problem of climate change, it developed its NDC with the conviction that the global ambition to counter the effects of climate change calls for a commitment from all parties with regard to mitigation and adaptation, as well as means of implementation, cooperative approaches and transparency. As a result, in compliance with Article 3 of the Paris Agreement, Morocco’s NDC presents the kingdom’s efforts to combat climate change across all of the aforementioned themes.", 
"Morocco’s National Circumstances", "Located on the southern shore of the Mediterranean, at the gates of Europe and northern Africa, Morocco has always been a crossroads of civilizations. In recent decades, Morocco has experienced substantial economic and social development within the context of climate change that has an impact on all sectors. Consequently, the pressure on natural resources has increased, affecting the resilience of forest ecosystems and the agriculture sector, particularly because of water scarcity. Water availability per capita was over three times higher in 1960 (approximately 2,600 m3 per capita per year) than it is today (approximately 700 m3 per capita per year).",

"", "This political will is today embodied by the kingdom’s 2011 Constitution, which gave it a new impetus by enshrining sustainable development as a right for all citizens, and by instituting new instruments of democratic governance, a condition to achieving sustainable development across the country. This political will is further enshrined in the Framework Law on the National Charter for Environment and Sustainable Development (NCESD), which asserts “the rights and duties inherent to the environment and sustainable development accorded to natural and legal persons and proclaims these principles to be respected by the state, local authorities and public institutions and businesses.”[1] The operationalization of the charter was undertaken through the preparation of the National Strategy for Sustainable Development (NSSD), which will guide the actions of all public institutions and private actors in furthering social and economic development that is both sustainable and dynamic.",

"Morocco is among the Mediterranean and African regions that have been exposed to the impacts of climate change for several decades now. In Morocco, the impacts of climate change take the form of a reduction in precipitation and snow cover, and a general rise in temperatures across the country.", "Historically, Morocco went through 20 years of drought in the past 70 years, which means almost one third of that period. Studies show that in the future, Morocco will become more arid due to a decrease in precipitation, a concurrent temperature increase, and extreme weather events occurring with higher frequency. Projections show that the country’s decrease in precipitation will be to the order of 20 % on a 2050-time horizon, with a greater impact in semi-arid plains. Morocco’s Third Communication to the UNFCCC, submitted in 2016, offers an exhaustive status report of Morocco’s vulnerability to climate change, and of the adaptation actions underway.", 
"Morocco is very vulnerable to climate change, due to its geographical location, and is prone to water scarcity, declining agricultural production, desertification, flooding and rising sea levels. Thanks to the kingdom’s great efforts with regards to human development, poverty in all forms has largely been eradicated in urban centers and has been greatly reduced in rural areas due to an increase in people’s living standards and efforts to reduce social disparities. However, these efforts are at risk of being counteracted by climate change’s negative impacts on the domestic economy and communities, including in rural areas. Thus, for Morocco, adaptation to climate change is the cornerstone of any program or policy on sustainable development. Some economic sectors or ecosystems are more sensitive than others to climate change, namely water, agriculture, fisheries, shorelines, forestry and health. For other sectors and ecosystems, a shortcoming of readily available data means that it is not currently available to provide a detailed description of their sensitivities.", 
"Water Sector Vulnerability", "In Morocco, water sources entirely dependent on precipitation are very vulnerable to the spatial and temporal climate variability, as well as climate change. Since the 1980s, these sources have faced the negative impacts of climate change and an increase in demand from resident and economic sectors, and have decreased substantially as a result. Morocco is one of the countries with the smallest volume of water per capita. Water potential is estimated to be 22 billion m3 annually, or water availability that is less than 700 m3/capita/year, for a population of 33.9 million people. Despite a considerable effort in the construction of hydraulic structures and access to unconventional resources, this quantity could fall to 500 m3 by 2030 due to the impacts of climate change, population growth and a growth in economic activity. Forecasts conducted on certain water basins indicate that water available to residents will decrease to the level of water shortage by 2050. Water sector vulnerability will be affected by the increasing costs of action, and the aging and deteriorating quality of surface and underground resources. Conventional water resources will no longer be enough to fulfill the needs of the citizens and of the various socioeconomic sectors. It has become necessary for Morocco to develop unconventional water resources (such as water desalination, demineralization of brackish water, recycling treated wastewater and harvesting rainwater).", 
"Vulnerability of the Agricultural Sector", "The agricultural sector is a central part of the Moroccan economy, having contributed more than 14 % to national accounts and employed over 39 % of the country’s labor force between 2008 and 2013. A large part of lands used for agriculture are not irrigated, making the sector vulnerable to climate change. Several years of droughts spanning over the last decades have affected the agricultural sector’s main types of crops — and thus the economy — and community living standards, including in rural areas. In addition, the geographic area where multiple arboreal species used for arboriculture are found has shrunk as a result of increasing temperatures. Numerous studies in Morocco have found that climate change will substantially affect irrigation capacities and crop yields, as well as the geographic area in which fruit trees and crops important for food security can grow. Climate change will hasten the degradation of natural resources essential to agriculture, notably water, soils and agricultural biodiversity. In addition, rangelands, which cover 82 % of the country’s arid land, are already facing a degradation of plant breeding resources, as a result of both anthropogenic and climate factors. This increasing desertification is having a negative impact on feedstock levels. Climate change is expected to increase the desertification of these lands, and increase degradation and accelerate the loss of yields in fragile, mountainous areas, in oasis ecosystems, and argan trees, which are already in decline. These ecosystems are vital to subsistence for at-risk populations, the protection of natural resources and the fight against desertification.", 
"Vulnerability of the Maritime Fisheries Sector", "The maritime fisheries sector contributes up to 2.3 % of Morocco’s GDP and directly or indirectly employs 660,000 people. It sustains 3 million people and makes up 15 % of total Moroccan exports, or 59 % of agri-food exports. Despite imprecise predictions, the sector is seen as one of the most vulnerable to climate change. The vulnerability stems from “upwelling” zones (which have a high fish density), sensitivities to climate change and the limited economic capacity of the affected communities. Climate change presents additional challenges, direct and indirect, to ocean and coastal ecosystems that are often already made fragile by other anthropogenic effects. The consequences of climate change, in addition to human activity, will affect the distribution and productivity of fish stocks, as well as the structure and productivity of certain ecosystems and their species’ populations. In Morocco, certain impacts of climate change, coupled with the overexploitation of fisheries resources, are already visible in the shift of mating periods, the migration and disappearance of certain species, the rising average temperature of marine waters, the reduction of the number of days amenable to fishing due to increases in flooding and storms, and the reduction of previously very abundant stocks.", 
"Vulnerability of the Coastline", "Morocco has 3,500 km of coastline along the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. Climate change will lead to an increase in flooding, the erosion of sand coastlines, and loos of coastal biodiversity and marine submersion. Because the vast majority of industrial, urban and tourist activity is clustered around coastal cities, climate change could impede the country’s socioeconomic development and lead to consequential environmental impacts in the absence of countervailing measures. Numerous beaches along both the Mediterranean and Atlantic shorelines have already faced severe erosion or have entirely disappeared, despite measures taken by public powers. Sea-level rise may submerge half of the land area of beaches by 2050 and 72 % of their area by 2100, and 187,400 people could be affected by flooding due to sea-level rise.", 
"Vulnerability of the Forestry Sector", "Forest ecosystems serve an important purpose for the country and the lives of vulnerable populations. They play a crucial role in the socioeconomic development of rural and mountain areas, including some of the most remote areas of the country. A great anthropogenic stress is induced on these ecosystems, a stress that Morocco strives to bring back to levels cognizant to their production capacity, through a participative approach with local communities. Forest ecosystems in Morocco are already witnessing the impacts of climate change, such as the sporadic decay of certain Middle Atlas cedar trees. Other imminent risks include more frequent and more severe wildfires, and phytosanitary problems stemming from the emergence of new pests. Climate change will have an impact on how vibrant and dynamic forest ecosystems are, on their ability to regenerate and to adapt to regular climate fluctuations, their biodiversity (both of their fauna and flora), their consistency, and their spatial distribution. Climate change will also induce catastrophic impacts on current key ecological balances knowing that extremely crucial orographic ranges make up parts of the country’s geography. Climate change will increase the risk that the surface area of some forest ecosystems (cedar trees, cork oak, cypress trees, argan trees, and others) shrinks and makes way for preforest, steppes, and desert ecosystems, which will have concomitant impacts both in terms of socioeconomic dynamics and in terms losses of ecosystem services.", 
"Vulnerability of the Health Sector", "Vulnerability to climate change of the health sector is explained by the presence of endemic illnesses such as malaria, schistosomiasis, typhoid and cholera, likely to be made worse by climate change. Even though resources are dedicated to combat the spread of these illnesses, resurgence as a result of the impacts of climate change is possible. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), climate change would increase deaths in Morocco by 250,000 annually between 2030 and 2050 due to malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat-related stress. According climate change scenarios, the vector capacity of the dengue virus would increase from 0.29 to 0.33 in 2070 relative to a reference value of 0.22. Diarrheal deaths attributed to climate change in children 15 and under would reach 10.5 %, or 1,600 deaths, in 2030. According to a high GHG emissions scenario, deaths in elderly populations as a result of heat should reach 50 for every 100,000 people by 2080, based on an estimated baseline of five deaths for every 100,000 people between 1961 and 1990. The impacts of climate change on agriculture will also disproportionally impact those most vulnerable to hunger and malnutrition.", 
"Vulnerability of the Tourism Sector", "Morocco is world-class destination, owing to the riches of its heritage, its diverse landscape and its proximity to Europe, as well as its accommodation, transport and communications facilities. Tourism represents 12 % of Morocco’s GDP, and is a substantial contributor to wealth creation and poverty reduction. In 2015, approximately USD 6 billion in revenues were generated from non-residents who visited Morocco, covering for 32 % of the country’s trade balance deficit. Through Vision 2020, the tourism sector is striving to position Morocco as a benchmark with regards to sustainable development across the Mediterranean shorelines by targeting three areas: seaside resorts, culture and nature. Nonetheless, the tourism sector faces significant challenges that are stemming from climate change. Mainly, the sector is anticipating strenuous circumstances with regards to water scarcity, decreasing snowcap, degradation of fragile ecosystems, vulnerability of seaside infrastructure, extreme weather events and new diseases that may spread due to rising temperatures.",

Over the period 2005–2010, Morocco devoted 64 % of all climate-related spending in the country to adaptation, particularly in the water sector, which represents 9 % of overall investment expenditures. More specifically, investments planned to achieve the desired targets in the water, agricultural and forestry sectors are estimated at USD 2.5 billion. Securing the national roadway system against additional climate change-induced floods would cost 5 % more than traditional maintenance costs.", 
"This considerable share of the national expenditures budget dedicated to adaptation demonstrates the magnitude of the challenges facing Moroccan society. And this share is certain to rise over time. Morocco expects to dedicate at least 15 % of its overall investment budgets to adapt to the impacts of climate change.", "Between 2020 and 2030, Morocco estimates that the cost of implementation of adaptation projects for the water, forestry and agriculture sectors, the sectors most vulnerable to climate change, will at a minimum reach USD 35 billion.",

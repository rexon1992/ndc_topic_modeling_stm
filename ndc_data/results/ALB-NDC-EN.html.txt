"Albania is a developing country with a per capita GDP of 10 thousand USD. It’s total greenhouse emissions are relatively low (8,4 M tons in 2009, of which roughly 60% is of the CO2 emissions) it is aiming to take its fair share from the efforts to avoid dangerous climate change. The country has unique emission profile as its electricity generation is based on renewable source generation at currently, with hydro power providing dominant part of it. Unfortunately, this hydro power capacity is vulnerable to climate change impacts. The unique electricity mix of Albania is positive in the sense that electricity system is on a level of decarbonisation what other countries aim for only on the long term, but it also means that there is limited opportunity for further policies and measures in this sector to reduce emissions. Maintaining the low greenhouse gas emission content of the electricity generation and decoupling growth from increase of greenhouse gas emissions in other sectors are the primary drivers of the country regarding mitigation contribution as its INDC. Having high uncertainty of data regarding non CO2 greenhouse gases results that Albania is to provide its INDC regarding CO2. If data quality of non‐CO2 greenhouse gases improves, Albania intends to expand its INDC to other greenhouse gases as well.", 
"The INDC of Albania is a baseline scenario target: it commits to reduce CO2 emissions compared to the baseline scenario in the period of 2016 and 2030 by 11.5 %. This reduction means 708 kT carbon‐dioxide emission reduction in 2030.", "The emission trajectory of Albania allows to have a smooth trend of achieving 2 tons of greenhouse gas emissions per capita by 2050, which can be taken as a target for global contraction and convergence of greenhouse gas emissions. In the following additional information is provided regarding the INDC in order to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding.",

Within the preparation process of the INDC it became clear that significant data uncertainty exist regarding the emissions of greenhouse gases other than CO2 and in sectors outside of sectors covered by the INDC. Improvements were made on existing modelling work and the scenarios presented are result of this work.",

Albania will take into account the ultimate objective of the UNFCCC in its future development and committed to decouple greenhouse gas emissions from its economic growth and embarks on a low emission development pathway. The INDC submitted by Albania is fair and ambitious because it aims to secure limited increase of its greenhouse gas emissions while it the country pursues a strong economic development pathway. Moreover, the pathway allows on long term for the convergence of Albania’s per capita emissions to the 2 ton/capita level.",

Development of the strategic directions for energy and transport sectors will take into consideration the INDC. Coordination of activities in relation to the strategy is foreseen to be coordinated by the Ministry of Environment which is the chair of the inter‐ministerial body on Climate Change. Albania also transposes and implements parts of the EU legislation, including legislation on climate change and builds capacity for its implementation which supports its ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Albania is a contracting party of the Energy Community Treaty which aims to extend the EU internal energy market to South East Europe and beyond on the basis of a legally binding framework. The overall objective of the Energy Community Treaty is to create a stable regulatory and market framework which also includes legislation aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",

NATIONAL CONTEXT ", "NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT GOALS AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY PRIORITIES ", "Coming 178th (out of 187 countries) on the Human Development Index, the Republic of Guinea suffers from severe structural vulnerabilities, despite recent progress. The national poverty rate stood at 55.2% in 2012, meaning that 6.2 million Guineans were living below the poverty line. Around one child in every three was suffering from malnutrition in 2012. In short, few Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are likely to be reached in 2015. Nevertheless, against a background of strong demographic growth (with the population doubling every 25 years), there is an urgent need to speed up and diversify economic growth to meet the present social challenges whilst not placing undue constraints on future generations.", 
"Sustainable development is therefore still a priority if the vital needs of the Guinean population are to be addressed. Moreover, the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the Republic of Guinea are well below the global average.", "OBJECTIVE OF THE INDC OF THE REPUBLIC OF GUINEA ", "The Republic of Guinea ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol in 1993 and 2005 respectively. Since then, it has worked out strategies to combat climate change, including its Initial National Communication, on the basis of an inventory of greenhouse gases (GHG) taken in 2001 (based on emissions in 1994). A second inventory was taken in 2011 (emissions in 2000), but has not yet led to the submission of a new National Communication. Finally, the Republic of Guinea prepared its National Adaptation Plan of Action (NAPA) in 2007 and undertook several projects to implement the plan.", 
"Guinea must now face up to two major challenges: lifting its people out of poverty and ensuring the country's food security – with a population growing at 3% per year and expected to reach 18 – 20 million in 2030. Its ambition is also to move from the status of Least Developed Country (LDC) to that of Emerging Country by 2030, which means that GDP must grow by 5-7% per year. Bearing in mind these aims and population growth, Guinea's energy needs may well double in the space of 20 years. Consequently, assuming that practices and systems remain unchanged, the estimated annual emissions growth rate is +4.4%, i.e. slightly more than doubling every 20 years.", 
"Guinea has particularly abundant natural resources, especially forests, meaning that it is considered as a carbon sink (Initial National Communication, 1994). In addition, more than 1000 watercourses and four of the major West African rivers rise in the country. These resources are under severe threat from the impact of climate change and regional population flows are likely to increase the pressure. Because of its geographical location, Guinea could become a refuge for people from neighbouring Sahelian countries to the north, especially pastoralists who are more seriously affected by drought and changes in rainfall patterns. Moreover, Guinea is of great significance to the aluminium industry in the world, as it holds more than one third of the planet's bauxite reserves.",

Its objectives include the development of information and communication concerning COP 21 and raising the awareness of civil society and economic operators. It comprises a high-level (ministerial) segment and 11 thematic panels which helped to draw up the INDC.", 
" 2. ADAPTATION COMMITMENTS ", "JUSTIFICATION FOR THE INCLUSION OF ADAPTATION IN THE INDC ", "Promoting sustainable economic development that takes account of adaptation to climate change is key to anticipating impacts and thus being able to reduce the expense and damage they can cause. In this regard, it is vital to include Guinea's main adaptation challenges in the INDC, in order to draw the attention of the international community to the massive efforts that the country needs to make to cope with the negative impacts of climate change, as well as to shoulder its responsibilities in relation to the vulnerability of the West African sub-region.", 
"Guinea finalized its National Adaptation Plan of Action (NAPA) in 2007, having identified the following vulnerable sectors: crop and livestock farming; water; and the coastal and forest zone. The NAPA also helped to identify the groups most vulnerable to climate change in different regions of the country, including in particular poor communities in rural areas such as farmers and small producers (men and women) and people whose livelihood mainly depends on the use of natural resources (hunters, fishermen, salt producers, etc.).", 
"Guinea has ratified the other two Rio conventions and put together national strategies to combat desertification and soil degradation, as well as conserve biodiversity. Implementation of these two strategies will also facilitate adaptation to climate change.", "IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ", "With its present favourable climate for agriculture (average annual rainfall of 1200 mm in the North and NorthEast, 4000 mm in Conakry and up to 1800 mm in the mountains of Fouta-Djalon), Guinea is both exposed and sensitive to climate change and has very little capacity to adapt. The main impacts of climate change affecting the country include: i) an overall increase in average temperatures; ii) a drop in average annual rainfall especially in North-West and North-East Guinea, together with a change in the frequency and intra-year distribution of precipitations; and iii) the rising sea level (around 80 cm by 2100). These new climate conditions could therefore have negative consequences for many different sectors.", 
"Nevertheless, even with altered rainfall patterns, Guinea should still continue to enjoy more favourable climatic conditions than its neighbours to the north and could become a more important transhumance destination for Sahelian herds than it is now, resulting in serious conflicts over land use.", "CURRENT AND PLANNED COMMITMENTS ", "Guinea is both sensitive and exposed to climate change. Located at the gates of the Sahel, one of the regions of the world most affected by climate change, Guinea must quickly reduce its vulnerability for the benefit of both its own people and its neighbours.",

As a result of climate change, the flow rate of watercourses will be reduced, possibly by as much as 50% of the current daily average by 2100. For example, the flow of the Niger River is likely to reduce everywhere by between 16 and 28% (sensitivity 2.5°C) and up to 23-54% (sensitivity 4.5°C). Given Guinea's strategic location upstream of the main West African catchment basins, choices in respect of water resource management will inevitably have impacts downstream, beyond the borders of Guinea. These international implications mean that Guinea has an even greater responsibility to manage its resources appropriately in the face of climate change.",

It is the country's leading economic area and holds around 38% of its population. It also plays a key role for the agricultural and energy sectors and accounts for 24% of national rice production. Potentially arable land on the coast amounts to 1.3 million hectares, including 380,000 ha under cultivation every year. Various cereal, fruit and vegetable crops and tubers are grown in the mangrove hinterland. More than 140,000 ha of the 385,000 ha of mangroves currently in existence have been converted into rice paddies. As regards energy, the mangroves in the zone provide 60% of domestic energy for the capital and the main coastal towns.", 
"The coastal zone is particularly vulnerable to climate change due to the rising sea level and intensified coastal erosion, leading to adverse effects on fishery resources, the destruction of infrastructure in coastal towns and villages and the disappearance or salinization of the rice paddies.", "All these factors mean that the coastal zone is under extreme pressure from the economic activities being undertaken there; the anarchic urbanization that arises from the lack of a Coast Code and noncompliance with the Land Code; and the impacts of climate change.",

Biomass energy supply chains cover several important areas where technologies and know-how can be applied to improve energy efficiency (production and consumption).", "Several programmes to disseminate improved stoves have therefore been put together and implemented since 1985, together with sustainable biomass management policies. In 1998, the Guinean government adopted a sector-based policy to manage traditional energies. One of the components is aimed at improving carbonization equipment for charcoal production. As a result of these policies, 256,711 stoves have been disseminated, saving 506,253 tonnes of wood-energy and thereby safeguarding 6575 ha of forest cover. The Integrated Programme of Access to Modern Energy Services (PRONIASE) plans to disseminate 10,000 improved wood- and charcoal-fired stoves and 2000 improved charcoal production kilns in 2015.

"Institutional support will be sought for capacity-building to enable Guinea to appoint and seek accreditation of a national implementing entity, thereby gaining direct access to the Green Fund.", "As an LDC, Guinea needs strong support from the Green Fund particularly for programmes relating to food security and energy efficiency.", "", "", "Carbon markets ", "Guinea is a Non-Annex I country under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and classed as a Least Developed Country (LDC). It supports the inclusion of the international carbon markets, such as the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), in a post2020 agreement on climate and proposes that such an instrument, coupled with an appropriate accounting system (Measuring, Reporting and Verification – MRV), should be used to help fund certain investments in low-carbon, climate change resilient infrastructure. Guinea considers that some of the low-carbon development options contained in this INDC, or additional activities, could be funded wholly or in part through the international transfer of carbon assets, whilst taking considerations of environmental integrity and transparency into account.", 
"Nevertheless, as no CDM project has been validated so far in Guinea, capacity-building would be essential.", "Furthermore, the Republic of Guinea has not yet formulated a REDD+ strategy, although it is in contact with the FAO to assess the country's needs in this connection.", "", "", "Private funding ", "The Republic of Guinea is particularly short of resources to meet the investment needs of its national budget. Increased resort to private finance could, in this connection, help to step up fulfilment of the commitments. Efforts made to improve the business climate (Guinea's progress in the World Bank Doing Business ranking bears witness to this) are likely to increase the investment propensities of private operators.", 
"In this regard, it can be seen that the social and environmental framing of private investment is somewhat uneven. Relatively exemplary in the case of the mining sector, regulation is less restrictive in other sectors (e.g. forests). Use of public-private partnerships should therefore be preceded by in-depth evaluation.", "Finally, the Guinean diaspora could make a more active contribution to the country's lowcarbon, climate change resilient development, namely by redirecting its financial flows (around US$150 million per year) towards the formal sector.",

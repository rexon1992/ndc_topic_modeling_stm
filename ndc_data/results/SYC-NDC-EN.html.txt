Further, excluding the offsetting capacity of ocean biomass and marine ecosystems (or blue carbon), Seychelles was a net sink of GHGs in 2000 at -564,232 tCO2e according to the Second National Communication (SNC), 2011. Accordingly, Seychelles is not expected to become a net emitter of GHGs before 2025. Voluntary emission reductions will only postpone the time when Seychelles will become a net emitter.", 
"According to the SNC, ~95% of all national emissions took place in the energy sector in 2000. The remaining 5% of national emissions was accounted by forestry. The generation of public electricity and transport accounted for 82.0% and 82.8% of all emissions in 2000 and 2007, respectively. Public electricity and transport are therefore priority sectors for emissions reductions. In 2000, emissions related to fuel combustion in cooking represented 6% of national emissions. These values show that the priority sector for mitigation is the energy sector, of which public electricity and transport are significant potential sub-sectors for GHG emission reductions.", 
"Emissions from industrial processes and agriculture are insignificant in Seychelles. The emissions from agriculture were deemed to be so insignificant that the SNC mentions that it might not be necessary to calculate emissions from agriculture in the future. Concerning forestry, it was estimated that 8,000 m 3 of biomass was harvested annually amounting to an annual emission of 12,540 tCO2. In contrast, the sink capacity of forests was 837,380 tCO2 with an expected loss in sink capacity of 1% every 5 years. Solid waste generated some 2,510 tCH4 in 2000 (SNC, 2011).", 
"In Seychelles, climate change mitigation to stabilize the climate system is not a primary objective. Mitigation is rather seen as an important outcome or by-product of decreasing the country’s dependence on imported fossil fuels (i.e. increase in energy security), and to enhance its balance of trade profile (through a reduction in its energy bill) (Seychelles National Climate Change Strategy, 2009). The energy bill of Seychelles represented 25.15% of its total import bill in 2014. Except for the generation of 2.15% of renewable electricity in 2014, all the other energy needs of the Seychelles were met from imported fossil fuels.",

Similarly, the emission factor = 0.65936 tCO2/MWh has been applied to obtain the emission reductions associated with demand side energy efficiency gains.

Using a target of 30% reduction in fuel use, which is expected to produce a proportional decrease in GHG emissions, the total emissions arising from road transport is expected to be 116.96 ktCO2 in 2030. This target corresponds to a reduction in emission of 50.13 ktCO2 in 2030. Assuming a target of 18% for 2025, the corresponding emission reduction is expected to be 26.5 ktCO2.",

With this contribution, Seychelles will be a net sink of GHGs by about 50 ktCO2 in 2030, and it will become a net emitter only after 2033.

Greater co-management of the sector by the Ministry of Tourism and Department of Risk and Disaster Management as well as with the Ministry of Environment, Energy and Climate Change.", "Food Security has been recognised by the Government as a crucial issue and it is widely understood within Government and agreed that there are clear linkages between water, food, ecosystem health and well-being of the people. Seychelles is in the process of implementing an ecosystem-based approach to watershed management and its implications for foods supply as well as water security. The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries is currently working on a feasibility study for a project to improve food and nutrition security and this project also addresses issues of water and soil management with reference to climate change.", 
"The Ministry recognises that sustainable modern agriculture requires new and innovative technologies, and investment supported by skilled and qualified human resources. The Ministry anticipates additional resources being committed to enhance human capacity development at the Seychelles Agricultural Agency, revitalising the extension services and also providing opportunities for young Seychellois to study climate-smart and ecosystem-based approaches to agriculture, put in place programmes for sustainable industrial and artisanal fisheries, sustainable mariculture, promote home gardening, improve port infrastructure for artisanal and industrial fisheries, reduce illegal, unreported and unregulated activities; and continue to support the insurance scheme for farmers and fishers.", 
"With so much territory protected from human land use and with a remarkably narrow coastal strip, Seychelles has real challenges in designing a future to take into account climate change which has jurisdiction over the entire coastal strip through, storm surge, high winds and salty air. Much has been made of the “blue economy” and for islands that would seem to be a logical consideration. Seychelles needs to fast-track its blue-economy ambition into action so that it can develop innovative and additive links with the Seychelles Strategic Plan 2015 which is in its closing formulation. For island states, it is too short-sighted in terms of climate change and island development to orchestrate land use plans without due consideration of the primary engine ~ the blue economy.", 
"A current Marine Spatial Planning project underway also has potential to coordinate connections between different interests in the blue economy, biodiversity, whether they be conservationist or exploitative in nature.", "The issue remains that little research has been done regarding the impacts of climate change on Seychelles’ fisheries, both industrial and artisanal, and more research will provide valuable insights to guide adaptation strategies for the fishing sector.", 
"With 50% of Seychelles under protection, that is an enviable basis for the future. The newly-launched Seychelles Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan addresses climate change as a cross-cutting theme and identifies a series of projects to improve biodiversity conservation though cross-referencing issues such as water and food security. A new Biodiversity law is currently being drafted which will update the existing laws related to the protection of biodiversity and strengthening of the capacity of those charged with their protection. There is a need to balance protected areas and room for development whilst developing a strong capacity for biosecurity. Such requirements offer ideal scope to inform a strengthened Blue Economy Research Institute.", 
"Water Security, particularly considering issues of storage and distribution, requires urgent attention and needs to take into account projected population growth, whilst reducing demand for treated water, using more rainwater, improving efficiency of the distribution system, and improving water storage capacity. Increasing water demand from the residential, commercial, agriculture, and tourism sectors is exacerbated by changes in rainfall patterns and a limited water storage capacity. The ecosystem-based watershed project mentioned previously is currently being implemented to address water supply from an ecosystem perspective. Another demonstration project is being implemented on La Digue focused on integrated water resource management. Both of these projects represent an integrated approach to water security that address issues such as ecosystem health, waste management, water treatment and supply, sewage, agriculture, etc. It is advocated that this approach is mainstreamed throughout island water resource management. In addition, the Public Utilities Corporation is currently implementing a project to improve water security by increasing efficiency of the system and reducing demand from consumers. This project also addresses the linkages between the treated water system and energy efficiency. It is essential that these endeavours are linked to the Blue Economy Research Institute to optimise knowledge-sharing and research throughout Government.", 
"Energy Security, particularly considering the reliance on fossil fuels is vital to the longer-term sustainability of Seychelles. There is a need to keep the options for diversifying electricity sources under continual review, whilst exploring more opportunities for the application of renewable energy technologies and strategies for using waste as an energy form. Commensurate with this, the distribution grid needs to maintain flexibility, and plans engaged to move critical infrastructure out of flooding/storm surge risk areas. Whilst the introduction of renewables is a usual early thought that has to be cautioned with detailed feasibility studies, innovations are possible, though require well-programmed research.", 
"Mechanised transport is essential given the terrain of Seychelles. This currently relies on fossil-fuelled vehicles and infrastructure that is degraded. Both require upgrading as these are critical and underpin all other sectors ~ moving people to school, work and shops. The departments responsible for road maintenance and repair in case of flooding, erosion and landslides collaborate to some degree to deal with crises, but a strengthening of cooperation between them in term of troubleshooting and planning would be desirable (e.g. Seychelles Land Transport Agency, the Department of Transport, Department of Risk and Disaster Management and the Ministry of Environment, Energy and Climate Change).", 
"The Health burden due to high-density populations in the coastal areas needs to be managed through improved research, response and planning. There are known challenges within the coastal zone related to chemical and solid waste.", "The conventional waste hierarchy (reduce, re-use, recycle) should be implemented fully and the use of organic waste for soil improvement promoted. Traditionally, on Seychelles, waste management has been mostly about disposal rather than looking at waste as an opportunity (especially through the circular economy). Seychelles has a relatively new waste policy (2013) which highlights the waste hierarchy with landfill being the last option, though for most forms of waste this may be the only option.", 
"Waste management sites are located in the limited coastal area on all three main islands; the new landfill on Mahé has been designed to collect leachate though this is only expected to last five to six years and thus far there is no plan or location identified for the next landfill. There is growing interest in business opportunities presented by recycling by the private sector, and this movement is being supported by the Government as well as by civil society organisations. The Government is conducting feasibility studies to look at the potential of a waste to energy facility, which would probably take the form of a biogas plant.", 
"To support the Statement of Current and Near-Term Planning and Action", "The Department of Risk and Disaster Management has mainstreamed climate change concerns into its work and is guided by a new policy and law (Disaster Risk Management Act, 2015) that provide clear guidance. The Department is receiving some support under various funding programmes but requires more input in terms of human and financial resources to fulfil the mandate as guided by the National Progress Report on The Implementation of the Hyogo Framework For Action (2013-2015) which details many actions focusing on building capacity in communities and districts to prepare for and respond to disaster (climate change mediated) events. In addition, the Seychelles National Disaster Risk Policy (2014) provides several areas for near-term action: Establishing sound, integrated and functional legal and institutional capacity for total disaster risk management in Seychelles; Improving risk identification, assessment and monitoring mechanisms in Seychelles; Reducing the underlying risk and vulnerability factors by improving disaster risk management applications at all levels; Strengthening disaster preparedness for effective response and recovery practices at all levels; and Enhancing information and knowledge management for disaster risk management.", 
"The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries is looking at food security issues, including nutritional issues, and has developed a Food and Nutrition Security Policy as well as an investment plan. The Ministry recognises that sustainable modern agriculture requires new and innovative technologies, and investment supported by skilled and qualified human resources. The Ministry anticipates additional resources being committed to enhance human capacity development at Seychelles Agricultural Agency, revitalising the extension services and also providing opportunities for young Seychellois to study climate-smart agriculture technologies.", 
"The Ministry of Education has recently integrated climate change into the secondary geography curriculum, and climate change issues are often addressed in extra-curricular school activities in primary (wildlife clubs) and secondary schools. Climate change has also been addressed in the programmes of many of the professional centres. The Ministry has the opportunity to identify opportunities for building on the work already being done, particular with respect to adaptation strategies related to the different sectors.", 
"The Ministry of Environment, Energy and Climate Change, through its Seychelles Energy Policy (2010- 2030) outlines key strategies for energy security and has a ten-year outlook and action plans for energy security, efficiency, renewable energy (as documented in the Seychelles Sustainable Development Strategy, Volume 2, Chapter 11 - Energy and Transport). Many of the planned projects are underway, the Energy Act is in force and has paved the way for the introduction of power supplied to the grid from diverse sources. Two GEF projects are being implemented, focused on energy efficiency and solar photovoltaic, both of which will also contribute significantly to an improvement in the energy security of Seychelles.", 
"The Ministry of Tourism has a master plan (2012 -2020) which indicates its focus on climate change where appropriate. The priorities for sustainable tourism are documented in the Seychelles Sustainable Development Strategy, Volume 2, Chapter 8 - Tourism and include: Minimising negative impacts of tourism on environment (and society) generally; and addressing climate change through training of tourism environmental representatives, training of the Seychelles Tourism Board in sustainable tourism development and training of environmental conservationists.", 
"The Ministry of Land Use and Habitat is largely guided by the Seychelles Strategic Plan (2015) which is the definitive document intended to guide land use management during the next 25 years to 2040. Climate change adaptation is a cross-cutting theme with maps/plans for areas for growth showing intense areas of development along east coast of Mahé including the Victoria area. There is little mention of risks due to sea level rise and storm surges and the plans contradict predictions from the Cuban Study projections (map chapter 3) which could be addressed through further research as indicated previously.", 
"The Ministry of Health recently developed a Seychelles National Climate Change and Health Adaptation Plan of Action (2014-2018) in collaboration with the Ministry of Environment, Energy and Climate Change. This plan will foster closer ties between the two ministries and guide adaptation efforts related to public health.", "The National Institute of Science, Technology and Innovation (NISTI) is a newly-enacted body under the Ministry of Investment, Entrepreneurial Development and Business Innovation. It has an oversight and leadership mandate with regards to the growth and development of science, technology and innovation across all sectors and programmes, and has potential to contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation action. Also of interest, is that it has been mandated to assist the transition to a Seychelles knowledge-based economy between now and 2026.",

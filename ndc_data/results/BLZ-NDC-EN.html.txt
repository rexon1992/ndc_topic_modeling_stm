"According to the recent systematic country diagnostic by the World Bank Group, Belize is one of countries in the world that is mostly affected by weather related events and other natural hazards. As such, Belize incurs annual losses of close to 4% of GDP due to natural disasters (Carneiro, 2016).", "According to the UNDP Country Profiles studies, an increase in air temperature ranging from 2oC - 4oC is projected by 2100 for Belize. Similar results were obtained from the Regional PRECIS model at 25 km resolution. Likewise a general decrease in annual rainfall of about 10% is projected by 2100. Other expected impacts include increased erosion and contamination of coastal areas, sea level rise, flooding and an increase in the intensity and occurrence of natural hazards such as hurricanes. Many of the effects of climate change are already being felt on the low lying coastal zone and are expected to have significant impacts on many environmental, physical, social and economic systems in Belize.", 
"In the agriculture sector, Belize expects a projected loss of production within the range of 10% to 20% which could lead to million dollars in lost revenue by the year 2100 (UNDP, 2009. Belize and Climate: The Cost of Inaction). The fisheries sector is also under threat from warmer sea surface temperatures, ocean acidification, sea-level rise, and extreme weather events. A decline in this industry can significantly affect Belize’s food security as well as our GDP. It would also affect over 3,500 licensed fishers, which could lead to an annual loss of approximately USD 12.5 million per year.", 
"The tourism industry in Belize, which is largely nature based and dependent on natural resources, will primarily be affected by extreme weather events, flooding, inundation, salt water intrusion and erosion which will occur as a result of rising sea levels. Climate Change will threaten the health of Belize’s coral reefs and will affect water supplies and physical property, all of which are critical for the sustainability of the sector. The combined effects of reduced tourism demand, loss of infrastructure, loss of beaches and the loss of the barrier reef can result in the reduced income of approximately USD 24.2 million per year.", 
"Addressing Climate Change: Policies, Plans and Programmes", "The Government of Belize has noted that, if these issues are not addressed, climate change will be considered as the single major threat to food and nutrition security, employment and economic prosperity and will obliterate many attainments that have been made towards achieving sustained development within the country.", "The NCCO is about to embark on development of the Fourth National Communication to the UNFCCC which will address gaps and produce updated information on climate trends and projected impacts. To guide the adaptation process, six sectoral vulnerability and adaptation assessments were completed under the Third National Communication to determine the country’s vulnerability profile and to identify possible adaptation options. The Integrated Vulnerability and Adaptation Assessment of Belize (Singh, et. al. 2014), made several cross-linkages between the impending impacts of climate change on six priority development sectors; namely, coastal development, agriculture, water, tourism, fisheries and health; further highlighting Belize’s extreme vulnerability. Building on the vulnerability and adaptation assessments, several key national and sectoral policies, strategies and action plans were developed and/or updated to incorporate climate change in an effort to enhance Belize’s resilience.", 
"A core objective of the NCCPSAP is the building of resilience in order to prevent, reduce or adapt to the negative impacts of Climate Change on key sectors, economic activities, society and the environment. The policy specifically recognized the negative effects on the social, economic and productive sectors such as the coastal zone and human settlement, fisheries and aquaculture, agriculture, forestry, tourism, water, energy and health; the physical environment including land, and infrastructure, such as roads and coastal structures; as well as the sustainability of natural resources such as marine and coastal areas, natural ecosystems, and biodiversity.", 
"In this regard, the policy is being implemented with the goal of guiding the short and long term processes of adaptation in accordance with national priorities and regional and international commitments. The policy aims to continue the mainstreaming process by facilitating the integration of climate change initiatives into national development plans and sectoral policies in order to facilitate an integrated, well- coordinated, approach to climate change management and sustainable development.", 
"Near Term Adaptation Actions and Co-benefits", "Recognizing the devastating effects that climate change poses for the people and country of Belize, the NCCPSAP proposes the implementation of various actions which are geared towards promoting adaptation in the short term and resilience in the longer term. Thus, strategies and actions have been prioritized for each sector to be implemented within the period of 2015 to 2020. The sectors of focus are agriculture, forestry, fisheries and aquaculture, coastal and marine resources, water resources, land use and human settlements, human health, energy, tourism and transportation.", 
"The stated actions are geared towards diversifying production, maintaining healthy ecosystems, encouraging sustainable exploitation of resources, supporting integrated development planning, assessing and addressing vulnerabilities and the development of tools to drive efficiency and promote resilience. As such, the action plan calls for, inter alia, the reviewing of national strategies and regulations, designing monitoring and evaluation frameworks, improving mangrove and habitat conservation and management, institutional strengthening, integrated water resource management and the undertaking of comprehensive assessments on human settlements and infrastructure.", 
"It is also recognized that many mitigation actions will produce co-benefits that promote adaptation and resilience to climate change. Forest protection and replanting of mangroves that are implemented for mitigation purposes are expected to protect the coastline against storm surges and erosion; which are increasing in frequency as a result of climate change. Likewise, many of the proposed actions in the waste, transport and electricity sectors are expected to produce additional adaptation co-benefits such as reduced water and air pollution, energy security, improved energy access, employment creation, and ecosystem protection; all of which lead to increase resilience to climate change.", 
"Institutional Arrangements", "Climate Change is noted to be a complex issue which needs appropriate responses to ensure that mainstreaming is carried out in a coordinated manner. In this regard, the Government of Belize has sought to establish a coherent, overarching governance structure to coordinate climate change management initiatives at the national level.", "This was accomplished with the establishment of the National Climate Change Office as a national entity which is committed towards the implementation of the NCCPSAP. To this end, the Office is strategically positioned to coordinate the implementation of climate change adaptation and mitigation actions and to implement climate change programmes. Additionally, the Belize National Climate Change Committee (BNCCC) was established as a broad based multi-stakeholder committee comprised of non- state, public and private sector representatives. The BNCCC provides overarching leadership and guidance to all climate change management actions and to review and advise government on the capacity building, institutional and other resource requirements needed to fully implement the strategy and action plan.",

With an emphasis on education and training, the GSDS also proposes the alignment of education and training to current labour market needs. Furthermore, the GSDS will develop programs to educate and provide employment opportunities to at-risk youth.", 
"Capacity building efforts around adaptation planning is a priority. In addition, resource needs are expected to be significant over the period used to implement the adaptation actions that are specified in the NCCPSAP. Some specific climate change adaptation needs in the sector plans include the need to educate different stakeholder groups about climate change adaptation measures and to help them develop capacity to research, develop and implement adaptation strategies. Some institutions have recognized the need to shift from general public awareness and education to a community based approach for environmental education programmes, which would address specific issues and concerns. These needs all tie in with the critical success factor 3 of the GSDS for “Sustained or improved health of natural, environmental, historical and cultural assets”.", 
"Research and Monitoring - Climate action depends on the availability of high-quality scientific information. Climate data, science, information, and knowledge are critical elements in all facets of development under a changing climate. Many government sectoral plans and strategies have express the need for research and monitoring related to climate change adaptation and mitigation but they lack the human and financial resources to fully undertake this task. The way forward will include innovative approaches in partnerships between the University, local agencies and overseas research institutions. Additionally, initiatives such as mangrove restoration and protection offer new opportunities in scientific field study to assess the carbon storage capacity of mangrove ecosystems, known as the Blue Economy.", 
"Technology - The GSDS encourages technology development and transfer, the building of institutional capacities and developing intelligence frameworks to support technology adoption and innovation, including green technologies. Technology for diversifying fossil fuels for renewable energy, or protecting critical infrastructure is prohibitively expensive. To address these challenges, alliances with overseas partners including donors need to be continued. There is also insufficient technological capacity to undertake effective research on climate change modelling and risks, monitoring of climate change impacts and implementation of adaptation measures.", 
"Coordination / Legislation - The mitigation and adaptation strategies and actions outlined earlier are cross sectoral and multidisciplinary in nature and will therefore require a coherent approach to implementation. This is currently a barrier as the responsibility for implementation falls within various ministries and government departments. While there is increased knowledge and appreciation for the need to implement these measures, several ministries still consider climate change an environmental issue and not a priority. The way forward is to adopt the recommendation to elevate the NCCO to a Climate Change Department fully responsible for coordinating all relevant mitigation and adaptation policies, strategies, plans and programmes across various sectors and Government Ministries. Legislation may need to be reviewed and amended and adequate financial resources sourced.", 
"Finance - Financial resources, for example, international climate finance, private sector and public sector finance will be required to implement the Climate Action Plan (mitigation and adaptation). Mitigation cost is estimated at reducing at around USD 10 million (excluding the cost of reducing transmission &amp; distribution losses and co-benefits from renewable energy) in NPV, using a 5% discount rate. Mitigation cost to reduce emissions from transmission&amp; distribution is estimated at USD 16-23 million of reduced electricity expenditures over 2015-2030. Mitigation cost to implement hydropower projects would be around USD 58 million (in NPV terms) and bagasse power plant would cost USD 39 million (in NPV terms).

Additional information", "Belize’s Climate Change Action Plan", "Belize’s Climate Change Action Plan focuses on building the capacity and resilience of the country to meet the challenges of climate change. In Belize, like most SIDs, GHG emissions are relatively small, but international commitments as well as opportunities to benefit from associated mitigation initiatives (reduced deforestation and energy conservation) has prompted their inclusion in the development of the National Climate Change Policy Strategy and Action Plan. Agriculture, land-use change and the forestry sector are considered prime areas for climate change adaptation but are also known to be contributors to GHG emissions and will require the development of policy initiatives to reduce such threats. The energy and transportation sectors, because of the benefits to be derived through the pursuit of sustainable energy and low-carbon development initiatives, will also require policy initiatives which seek to limit emissions of GHGs. Belize identified the following key sectors for which adaptation and mitigation strategy and action plans will be addressed; these are:",

"Integrating Climate Change in Revised National Plan: Belize is well known for its pristine forests and is reported to have the highest forest cover in both Central America and the Caribbean (62% as a percentage of land, 37% of which are primary forests). However, the forests of Belize, like other natural resource sectors, are anticipated to be impacted by the various manifestations of climate change. The proposed interventions to mainstream adaptation and mitigation to climate change will be achieved by providing guidance for actions that concerns the direct and indirect threats posed by global climate change on forests and forest dependent people in order to reduce their vulnerability, increase their resilience and adaptation to climate change. The estimated cost for planned activities totals approximately USD $5,158,000.", 
"Sustainable Management of the Fisheries Sector: The fisheries sector is important to Belize because it is an important food source, provides an income and livelihood for several persons as well as an earner of important foreign exchange. Given the importance of the fisheries sector as a source of food and earner of foreign exchange, it is imperative that management measures are introduced to ensure its sustainability including addressing the threats of climate change. Interventions under the fisheries sector aim to achieve the sustainable management of the fisheries resources, and the conservation and preservation of fisheries resources and marine habitats in promoting reef ecosystem resilience. Estimated cost is approximately USD$ 500,000 annually.", 
"Implementation of the Belize Integrated Coastal Zone Management Plan: The importance of the coastal zone in the productive sector of Belize is increasing rapidly. Most industries in Belize are either directly or indirectly reliant on some component of the coastal environment to function. Industries such as fishing and tourism are dependent on the organisms that inhabit the coastal area to sustain them. Other industries such as agriculture, aquaculture, and petroleum use the coastal waters to transport their products, thereby allowing them to engage in overseas trade. Rapid economic development, directly attributed to tourism and recreational activities and population growth, have led to increasing pressures on coastal and marine resources, with implications to the livelihoods of those that depend upon them. These anthropogenic threats are compounded by natural hazards, global warming and rising sea levels and the vulnerability of sensitive coastal ecological systems to climate change. It is therefore, imperative to ensure that the coastal zone is managed and utilized in a manner that will continue to support important ecological functions, as well as social, cultural and economic prosperity for current and future generations. The overall objective is to promote the adoption and implementation of the Belize Integrated Coastal Zone Management Plan which will ensure responsible and sustainable use of Belize’s coastal and marine resources in the face of climate change. The cost of activities to promote the adoption and implementation of the Belize Integrated Coastal Zone Management Plan is estimated at approximately USD $500,000 annually.", 
"Improved Integrated Water Resource Management: Due to its geographic location, relatively high level of forest cover, and 18 different water catchment areas, Belize is recognized as having an adequate supply of freshwater. However, like other resource sectors, a number of anthropogenic factors (increases in demand due to expansion in the agricultural, industrial and tourism sectors, a growing population and accompanying water pollution and watershed destruction), together with impending threats of climate change, are placing a heavy strain on the sustainability of this resource. The overall goal is to enhance the protection and restoration of forest ecosystems and build the resiliency of water catchment areas. Activities to realize the goal are: Develop Regulations to complement the commencement of the National Integrated Water Resources Management ACT (2010); operationalization of the National Integrated Water Resources Authority (NIWRA): capacity building for the Hydrology Unit to transition to the Authority; develop a Water Vulnerability Profile to support the Water Master Plan; prepare a National Water Master Plan for the entire country; and, complete feasibility studies for a National Water Quality Laboratory. Resources including estimated cost for the following planned activities will be around USD 1,500, 000.", 
"Integrate Climate Change in the Tourism Sector: In Belize, like most other SIDS, most of the tourist assets are located within the narrow coastal belt and the growth of the industry is perceived as having a potential detrimental effect on the environmental resources on which it is dependent. The goal is to assess the vulnerability of Belize’s tourism system to climate change and ensuring the mainstreaming of climate change considerations throughout the sector to enhance ecosystem resilience, equitable distribution of tourism activities and fostering of sustainable tourism development, at a local and national scale.", 
"Building Resilience of Human Settlements: The strategy is to promote the adoption of an integrated land tenure and land classification policy and developing and implementing programmes which discourage the establishment of human settlements in areas prone to natural hazards (flooding, land slippages, high winds and storm surges), and develop housing and settlement patterns/practices that enhance climate change adaptation and are resilient to climate change. The resources including estimated cost for the following planned activities are yet to be determined.", 
"Enhance Resiliency of Transportation Sector: Several of Belize’s roads and bridges are vulnerable to seasonal floods. Belize’s waterways also become un-navigable during certain periods In the absence of a transport policy, it is imperative that a vulnerability assessment is undertaken with greater focus being placed on assessing the vulnerability of the transport infrastructure, particularly in urban areas and other areas which are critical in sustaining the country’s productive sectors (tourism, agriculture and ports). An improved and energy efficient transport sector will not only reduce the country’s vulnerability to storm surges and floods, but also assist in reducing GHG emission. The resources including estimated cost for the following planned activities are yet to be determined.", 
"Strengthened and Improved Human Health: It is important that the Ministry of Health undertake a Vulnerability and Capacity Assessment for the health sector. This is important for the country to be well informed of the impacts of climate change on the health sector and the adoption of practices and technologies that will reduce exposure and health impacts from extreme heat, and improve physical infrastructure of health institutions and their functional capacity. The resources including estimated cost for the following planned activities are yet to be determined.", 
"Improved Waste Management: Until a few years ago, the uncontrolled dumping and burning of garbage, as a form of final disposal throughout Belize, was quite common. Such practices, compounded by inadequate waste collection systems and the lack of technical and environmental controls have impact on the health of the population and pollution of the nearby ocean, thereby affecting coral reefs and affecting the livelihood of thousands of Belizeans whose livelihoods are directly and indirectly linked to fishing and eco-tourism. The overall goal is to implement a National Integrated Waste Management Programme including programmes to reduce, reuse, recover and recycle solid waste and reduce greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere.",

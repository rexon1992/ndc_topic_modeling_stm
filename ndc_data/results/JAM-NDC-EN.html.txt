The National Context", "Jamaica is a member of the group of Small Island Developing States (SIDS). An island nation in the Caribbean Sea, it is part of the group of islands known as the Greater Antilles that also includes Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Hispaniola, and of the Caribbean sub-region more generally. Jamaica acceded to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1995.", 
"As a small island developing state, Jamaica is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change not only in terms of our natural resources, but also its economic development, as sectors such as tourism, agriculture, fisheries, forestry and water are climate sensitive, as is social wellbeing. Jamaica’s susceptibility to natural disasters has proven to be a major threat to the stability of human settlements and infrastructure.", "At the international level, as a Party to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its Kyoto Protocol, Jamaica has been active in negotiations pressing the case of small island developing states (SIDS) for there to be substantial reductions in the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) and for adequate funding to be made available to assist SIDS which are not responsible for the high levels of GHG emissions. Despite not being a major emitter, Jamaica is nonetheless playing its part in reducing its GHG emissions through ‘no regrets’ mitigation actions, which can lead to reduced emissions as well as cost savings and social and environmental benefits for the country. Jamaica will also focus in the UNFCCC negotiations on approaches to address loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change, including impacts related to extreme weather events and slow onset events, as where there are constraints and limitations to adaptation, then other means of addressing economic loss and damage from climate change impacts will have to be found.", 
"Vision Statement: Jamaica achieves its goals of growth and prosperity for its people while meeting the challenges of climate change as a country with enhanced resilience and capacity to adapt to the impacts and to mitigate the causes in a coordinated, effective and sustainable manner.", "2. Mitigation Contribution", "2.1 Scope", "Jamaica’s intended nationally determined contribution covers actions in the energy sector (IPCC source category 1). It includes emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, non-methane volatile organic compounds, and sulphur dioxide. The entire national territory of Jamaica is covered by the scope.", 
"2.2 Policy Actions", "As Jamaica develops economically, it is expected that there will be some continued growth in emissions. However, Jamaica has undertaken a programme of modernization of energy infrastructure, diversification of energy sources towards cleaner and renewable fuels, and incentivising efficiency that is expected to significantly reduce emissions growth over time.", "Jamaica will contribute to the global GHG emissions reduction by fully implementing energy policies that will ensure, inter alia, that:", 
"", "Jamaicans use energy wisely and aggressively pursue opportunities for conservation and efficiency", "Jamaica has a modernized and expanded energy infrastructure that enhances energy generation capacity and ensures that energy supplies are safely, reliably, and affordably transported to homes, communities and the productive sectors on a sustainable basis", "Jamaica realizes its energy resource potential through the development of renewable energy sources by increasing the share of renewable sources of energy in its primary energy mix to 20% by 2030",

Under the BAU scenario, GHG emissions would increase by 37% by 2030 (see Table 1).", 
"Jamaica’s intended nationally determined contribution will mitigate the equivalent of 1.1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year by 2030 versus the BAU scenario. This is a reduction of 7.8% of emissions versus BAU. This target is predicated on the current level of implementation of the National Energy Policy and the existing pipeline of renewable energy projects. [1]", "Jamaica will conditionally increase its ambition to a reduction of GHG emissions of 10% below the BAU scenario, subject to the provision of international support. This reduction target is based on enhanced implementation of the NEP. In particular, Jamaica seeks support for the expansion of energy efficiency initiatives in the electricity and transportation sectors, in line with sector action plans and policies currently under development.",

"4. Planning Processes for Implementation", "Jamaica will implement this INDC through the Climate Change Policy Framework and the National Energy Policy 2009-2030. Additionally, Jamaica has developed a nationally appropriate mitigation action for the scale-up of renewable electricity that will be central to the full implementation of this INDC.", "Institutionally, the Climate Change Division of the Ministry of Water, Land, Environment and Climate Change will be responsible for coordinating actions among government ministries, departments and agencies to implement the INDC, as well as creating an enabling environment for necessary private sector action.", 
"5. Additional Information", "5.1 ADAPTATION", "Background", "Jamaica is experiencing changes in variability in rainfall patterns and other climate parameters. While some of these changes are due to natural variability, some are attributable to climate change. The IPCC considers inhabitants of small islands, like Jamaica, to be some of the most vulnerable to climate change. This is because climate change will impact their societies, economies and ecosystems in ways that will increase vulnerabilities; for example with regard to food security, water supply, natural disasters, and human health. The impact of climate variability has already been experienced in some of these areas.", 
"As a small island developing state, Jamaica is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change not only in terms of our natural resources, but also our social wellbeing and our economic development, as sectors such as tourism, agriculture, fisheries, forestry and water are very climate sensitive. Jamaica’s vulnerability to climate change impacts is further compounded by social issues such as poverty, the location of human settlements in high risk areas, environmental degradation, and instances of poorly constructed infrastructure and housing.", 
"The severe weather events which have impacted the country over the years have severely/significantly affected the country’s economic growth and development. Between 2001 and 2012, Jamaica experienced 11 storm events (including 5 major hurricanes) and several flood and drought events. These events resulted in combined loss and damage amounting to approximately J$128.54 billion. In 2004, Hurricane Ivan caused losses equivalent to 8.0% of GDP. Hurricane Sandy (2012) accounted for J$9.7 billion or 0.8% of 2011 GDP in direct and indirect damage, as well as increased expenditure by private and Government entities. The health, housing and education sectors experienced the greatest impact accounting for 48% of the total costs in damages. One death and 291 injuries resulted from Hurricane Sandy. These are but a few examples of the impacts of increased frequency of natural disasters.", 
"Adaptation Planning Process", "At the national level, a number of projects on adaptation to climate change have been implemented. These include community-based adaptation and initiatives to raise the awareness of the public in general, and vulnerable groups in particular, regarding the impacts of climate change and how it can be addressed.", "Jamaica’s Vision 2030 Jamaica - National Development Plan provides the framework to ensure that climate change issues are integrated into national policies and development activities. The issue of adaptation to climate change is specifically addressed under National Outcome #14 ‘Hazard Risk Reduction and Adaptation to Climate Change’. The key related national strategies are: (i) develop measures to adapt to climate change, and (ii) develop mechanisms to influence the global rate of climate change.", 
"Jamaica’s Climate Change Policy Framework was prepared under a GoJ/EU/UNEP Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Reduction (CCADRR) Project. The policy development process involved a number of consultations, using as a basis, Vision 2030 Jamaica - National Development Plan and Jamaica’s Second National Communication on Climate Change to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Climate Change Policy Framework is intended to support the goals of Vision 2030 by reducing the risks posed by climate change to all of Jamaica’s sectors and development goals.", 
"The Climate Change Policy Framework outlines the objectives, principles and strategies that the country will employ in order to effectively respond to the impacts and challenges of climate change, through measures which are appropriate for varying scales and magnitudes of climate change impacts. It is expected that, on the basis of this Policy Framework, the relevant sectors will develop or update, as appropriate, plans addressing climate change adaptation and mitigation.", "The objectives of the Policy Framework are:", 
"", "To mainstream climate change considerations into national policies and all types and levels of development planning and to build the country’s capacity to develop and implement climate change adaptation and mitigation activities.", "To support the institutions responsible for research, data collection, analysis and projections at the national level on climate change, its impacts, and appropriate adaptation and mitigation measures, to facilitate informed decision-making and strategic actions at all levels.",

"Jamaica intends to implement early actions to address our adaptation efforts through a number of Special Initiatives.", "Institutional Framework and Actions Taken", "Since 2012, Jamaica has raised the profile of climate change issues by assigning the portfolio to a Ministry. Additionally, Jamaica has established a Climate Change Division (CCD), with a specific mandate to address climate change issues including adaptation.", "Jamaica is in the process of appointing a Climate Change Advisory Board (CCAB) which shall comprise representatives of the public and private sectors, academia and non-governmental organizations appointed by the Minister with portfolio responsibility for climate change. This Board will provide a platform for the exchange of scientific and technical information on climate change and related issues of importance to Jamaica and advise the Minister and the CCD.", 
"The Government has recognized that, given the cross-cutting nature of climate change, there is an urgent need to develop an integrated approach in order to effectively build resilience at all levels and to have the required enabling policies in place. To facilitate a multi-sectoral approach to climate change, the Government of Jamaica has established the Climate Change Focal Point Network (CCFPN), comprising representatives from key Ministries, departments and agencies. The focal points are responsible for coordinating the development and implementation of their respective sectoral strategies and actions with respect to climate change in collaboration with the CCD, and the integration of climate change considerations into their respective policies, plans and programmes. The focal points will ensure the preparation and provision of periodic monitoring reports on these strategies and action plans to the CCD, and have been provided with climate risk screening tools and other training to facilitate climate resilience in policy and project development. Over time, representation on the Network will be expanded to the sub- national level, to include representation from local government, civil society groups, community organizations and the private sector, to increase the reach and participation.", 
"In addition, Jamaica is currently working on several sector strategies and action plans within the forestry, agriculture and fisheries sector. Additional sectors expected to be actioned in the near- term include human health, tourism, water, human settlement and coastal resources, transport, energy, waste and finance sectors. Jamaica is currently preparing its third National Communication and first Biennial Update Report with a focus on the health, forestry, agriculture, water and tourism sectors.", 
"Jamaica has already taken steps to assist the public and private sectors, community based organizations and non-governmental organisations in implementing adaptation efforts by making it easier to access funding as well as avenues for capacity building activities, including training in communication of climate change information. The country has also prepared, in collaboration with other regional governments and the UNEP, a proposal to support the implementation of an Urban Ecosystem-Based Adaptation project in the capital city of Kingston. This Project will increase the resilience of Kingston using ecosystem based approaches.", 
"In May 2009, Jamaica accepted the offer extended by the Sub-Committee of the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) to participate in the PPCR as one of the six countries in the Caribbean regional pilot program. The other five countries are Grenada, St. Vincent, St. Lucia, Dominica, and Haiti. The pilot programmes and projects that are being implemented under the PPCR in Jamaica are to be led by the Planning Institute of Jamaica, a statutory body under the Ministry of Finance &amp; Planning, and the Ministry of Water, Land, Environment &amp; Climate Change. The PPCR will build on the Hazard Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation component of Vision 2030 Jamaica - National Development Plan and the Second National Communication to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).",

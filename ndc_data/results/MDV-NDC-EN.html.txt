The country consists of about 1190 islands and the population is distributed over approximately 197 inhabited islands. The country’s main economic sectors are tourism and fisheries, both of which are extremely climate- sensitive.", "The challenges Maldives faces in the context of climate change and development are similar to other small island nations. These challenges include, but are not imited to, the low lying nature of the islands, high population density, high levels of poverty, and a dispersed geography. Because Maldives is a small low lying island nation, its vulnerability to climate change impacts and associated extreme weather events and disasters are significantly greater due to limited ecological, socio-economic, and technological capacities. Maldives’ geography also makes communication difficult and transport expensive. Maldives’ small, physically isolated economy is highly susceptible to global influences and shocks.", 
"Continuous efforts are being undertaken to increase adaptation actions and opportunities, and to undertake low emission development. However, limited financial resources, capacity and technology remain as major challenges in addressing the impacts of climate change.", "Maldives’ high level of fuel imports poses a number of challenges. The country’s energy demand is completely met by imported fossil fuel. Therefore it is imperative that the Maldives explore, develop and deploy indigenous, clean and renewable sources to meet energy demand and ensure energy security.", 
"Maldives’ 2011 energy balance shows that there was approximately 313 kilo tonnes of oil equivalent (ktoe) of energy consumed in the Maldives of which over 80% was from imported diesel oil as shown in Figure 1. Energy consumption contributes to about 1.04 million tonnes of CO2 emissions in 2011 which is about 0.003% of global emissions. Energy consumption in various sectors constitutes a major share of the country’s GHG emissions. Although there has been some solar photovoltaic (PV) penetration, this amount is insignificant compared to the country’s energy demand.", 
"", "Figure 1. Energy consumption by source in the Maldives for 2011", "Considering the growth rate of the imported fossil fuel usage in the country, it is estimated that under the BAU scenario will generate about 3.3 million tonnes CO2 equivalent by year 2030. Maldives intends to take actions and undertakings to reduce unconditionally 10% of its GHG emissions (under a BAU) by the year 2030. These actions and undertakings could be scaled-up to 24% in a conditional manner, in the context of sustainable development, supported and enabled by availability of financial resources, technology transfer and capacity building.",

As the 2030 projection describes the business as usual (BAU) scenario, energy services by 2030 were assumed to be produced and consumed with the same technologies and efficiencies as were assumed for the 2011-energy balance.

However, Maldives is taking actions and undertakings in accordance with common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities to achieve the ultimate objective of United Nations Convention Framework on Climate Change. ", "The main area of focus for mitigation is fuel switching to alternative energy options, which is severely constrained by the limited land area, geographic isolation of islands and geographic dispersion of populations. Solar irradiance is available in the country throughout the year, however due to lack of technical capacity, limited land area, already established diesel based power generation systems and high investment costs pose a major challenge to the introduction of solar PV systems in the country. Although ocean currents and the waves surrounding each island might be the perfect renewable energy resource for the Maldives and other SIDS, the technologies to harness them are still at pilot stages around the world and commercially not available. Wind resources are low due to the low lying and flat nature of the country, but efforts are ongoing to incorporate it into the energy mix.", 
"These unfavorable conditions and barriers severely limit the use of alternative energy sources in the Maldives and have resulted in Maldives being heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels.

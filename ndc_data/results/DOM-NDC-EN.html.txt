"", "For the realization of this vision, the 2030 National Development Strategy (NDS) articulates public policy in several key areas of development. This strategy promotes the transformation of society to a culture of sustainable production and consumption, which manages risks with equity and efficiency, protection of the environment and natural resources, and promoting adequate climate change adaptation. This is a huge challenge given national circumstances, territorial conditions and environmental features that add to and exacerbate the challenges imposed by climate change.", 
"As a highly vulnerable country, the Dominican Republic aspires to achieve a global agreement that limits the increase in global average temperature to 2°C, with progressive reduction to 1.5°C, based on the scientific consensus.", "The Dominican Republic’s intended nationally determined contribution has been designed based on national capacities, envisaged financing conditions and national circumstances.", "", "", "",

Furthermore, multisectoral consultations have identified specific actions for climate change adaptation and mitigation.",

"In terms of emissions, the Dominican Republic represents less than 0.1% of global emissions. Per capita emissions are below the average for Latin America and the Caribbean region (4.9 tCO2e). However, the emissions trends of some economic sectors are important, especially transport, energy, manufacturing and construction, waste and agriculture.", "", "", "Adaptation", "Adaptation is a constitutional priority for the country.

"As a small island developing state, and being located in an area of intense hurricane activity, the Dominican Republic is threatened constantly by hydro-meteorological events such as tropical storms, droughts and hurricanes affecting human settlements and productive activities. ", "Damage associated with hydro-meteorological events over the years has left a trail of effects demanded beyond considerable efforts. In 1998, Hurricane Georges caused losses and damages equivalent to 14% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1997. The tropical storms Olga and Noel in 2007 forced the government to adjust its priorities and the economy, causing losses and damages of 1.2% of GDP and 5.3% of the national budget. Additionally, the damage caused by many otherdisasters including floods, landslides and droughts have not been quantified.", 
"The impacts of some extreme events have meant economic losses in the order of USD 9,470 million, and the most affected sectors have been: agriculture, transportation, energy, housing, education, industry and trade, sanitation, drainage, health and environment. These statistics refer to major events that cause disasters, but smaller and recurrent events can cause major damage to property, livelihoods and crops. However, certain gaps in the historical record of medium and small events persist, and the amount is estimated to be equal to half of the loss and damage of the biggest events.",

The tourism sector will have to face the consequences of hydro-meteorological phenomena in the coming years. To combat this, it is estimated that the sector will need incremental financial flows of USD 358.3 million (2005 dollars) for the period 2005-2030.", 
"In terms of mitigation, CCDP’s implementation has an approximate cost of USD 17,000 million (2010 Dollars) in the energy, transport, forestry, tourism, solid waste and cement sectors for the period 2010-2030; to achieve emission reductions in the order of 25 MtCO2e. These costs are associated with the identified measures that have mitigation potential, not with structural measures to modify or promote an enabling environment in these sectors.", "The National Strategy to Strengthen Human Resources and Skills to Advance Green, Low Emission and Climate Resilient Development identifies financing needs that exceed USD 1.5 million per year for projects of Higher Education, Technical-Vocational education and specializations.",

Base year emission estimation is 8307 Gg of CO2 equivalent. The targeted emissions reduction will be achieved domestically through strategies and measures which are relevant for the implementation of the target. Consequently, achieving such targets is a function of resource availability and appropriate legal frameworks. Achieving the 15% greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions reduction target requires robust and comprehensive planning within the sectors. Consequently, it is essential that there are conducive legal frameworks in place to enable the achievement of the national target. This proposed emission reduction path will be subjected to legislative review and endorsement by Parliament.", 
"Botswana is developing a Climate Change Policy and Institutional Framework which will be supported by a Strategy and Action Plan to operationalize the Policy. The Policy will be approved by Parliament in 2016. In addition to the national policy, the development of a strategy will involve development of a long term low carbon strategy, a national adaptation plan, nationally appropriate mitigation actions, identification of technologies, plan for knowledge management capacity development, education and public awareness and a financial mechanism. This total package will ensure that the policy is implementable.", 
"", "", "", "Mitigation Contribution", "The country intends,to achieve an overall emissions reduction of 15% by 2030, taking 2010 as the base year. The emission reduction target was estimated based on the baseline inventory for the three GHGs being carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). The reductions will be realised from the energy sources which is categorised as the stationary and mobile sources. The country will also continuously implement mitigation measures for the livestock sector to reduce CH4 emissions mainly from enteric fermentation though these initiatives are not estimated in the 15%. Initiatives for emission reductions will be developed from long term low carbon strategy",

Consequently, calculations of GHGs emissions were based on the IPCC Guidelines. For other non-energy sectors such as waste and agriculture, IPCC spreadsheets were adopted and data was input to generate emissions statistics.

The development of the NAP calls for a broader stakeholder consultation so that the products of this process represent the views and aspirations of all the stakeholders and respond to their needs. The outcome of this process will be significant in guiding how the country responds to the development challenges across all sectors that are attributed to global warming and climate change. This will be informed by already exiting climate change information, socio-economic and development indicators, local experiences as well as existing policies, plans and institutional frameworks. National Adaptation Plan development is coordinated by Ministry of Environment Wildlife and Tourism, with support from the National Committee on Climate Change.",

Extreme droughts based on low rainfall and soil conditions are most common in south-western Botswana and high rainfall events with risks of floods are most likely in north- eastern Botswana where several large dams are located in this area. Droughts are projected to increase in frequency and severity. Botswana is already witnessing impacts of climate change with constrained agricultural production, increasing food insecurity and increasing water stress, which will worsen with time, as projected.", 
"Prior to the Second National Communication to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change which identified various adaptation measures, the Government of Botswana had initiated strategies to adapt to drought episodes which are cyclical in nature to reduce vulnerability.

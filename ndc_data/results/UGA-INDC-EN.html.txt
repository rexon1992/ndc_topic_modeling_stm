Through regular participation in the meetings of the Conference of Parties to the UNFCCC, Uganda is keenly following the events leading to the new Climate Change Agreement to be negotiated in Paris, France during the UN Climate Conference in December 2015.", 
"Uganda has contributed least to the potentially catastrophic build up of the human-derived greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere and yet the country is most vulnerable to global warming and climate change impacts. (Uganda has one of the lowest green-house gas emissions per capita in the world, estimated at 1 . 3 9 tons carbon dioxide, far below the global average of approximately 7.99 tons of carbon dioxide. Furthermore, Uganda’s contribution t o world’s total green-house emission is estimated a t 0.099%).", 
"Consequently Uganda recognizes the importance of fulfilling the commitments under the respective article of the Convention on Climate Change, particularly the Principle of “common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capacities”.", "The actions reflected in this Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) have been derived through a consultative process and reflect a national resolve to respond to the call by the global community to initiate domestic preparations for nationally determined contributions towards curbing temperature rise to below 2°C by the end of the century.", 
"I a m pleased to convey to the International Community this fulfilment from the Government and the People of Uganda.", "Prof. Ephraim Kamuntu", "MINISTER OF WATER AND ENVIRONMENT", "October 14, 2015", "SUMMARY", "a) Uganda is submitting its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution in compliance with Decision 1/CP.19 (Further advancing the Durban Platform: and in particular Paragraph 1 (b &amp; c)) and as elaborated in Decision 1/CP.20 (Lima Call for Climate Action and in particular paragraph 11) premised on the Convention and guided by its principles.", 
"b) The livelihood of the people of Uganda is highly dependent on the exploitation of her natural resources, including climate. In submitting this INDC, Uganda’s priority is adaptation. The country will continue to work on reducing vulnerability and addressing adaptation in agriculture and livestock, forestry, infrastructure (with an emphasis on human settlements, social infrastructure and transport), water, energy, health and disaster risk management. Sustainable Land Management (SLM) and Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) will be scaled up to increase resilience at the grassroots level.", 
"c) For mitigation, Uganda is to focus on implementation of a series of policies and measures in the energy supply, forestry and wetland sectors. In the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario the estimated emissions in 2030 will be 77.3 Million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year (MtCO2eq/yr).The estimated potential cumulative impact of the policies and measures could result in approximately 22% reduction of national green house gas emissions in 2030 compared to business-as-usual. Uganda proposes to implement the identified policies and measures, and their impact may be higher or lower than these estimations illustrate.", 
"d) Contributions under this Intended Nationally Determined Contribution include crosscutting respect for human rights and gender-responsive climate change actions. The protection of vulnerable groups, is a crosscutting priority. including women,", "e) The Government of Uganda will continue to commit resources to climate change-relevant strategies. However, the full implementation of these actions is conditional on the support of international community coming from both climate finance instruments and international market mechanisms. As set out in the Uganda National Climate Change Policy and its Costed Implementation Strategy, national sources are assumed to cover approximately 30% of incremental costs of the activities in the next 15 years, with 70% assumed to originate from international sources.", 
"1. National Circumstances", "Uganda, one of the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) in East Africa, occupies an area of 241,038 square kilometres, with water bodies and wetlands covering about a third of it, and standing astride the equator. Its tropical climate has an average temperature ranging from 18 to 28 degrees centigrade, and this provides the country with a rich natural resource base. With an average total fertility rate of 6 children per woman, Uganda has an annual growth rate of 3.2 per cent; and the population is expected to grow from 34.8 million people in 2014 to 93.4 million people in the 2040s. In terms of capacity, as a Least Developed Country, Uganda has a low per capita income of United States dollars 584, coming from economic development that depends largely on natural resource.", 
"Uganda has diverse socio-economic concerns embedded in a multi-cultural society with a multi-party political system and a diversity of religious practices. Outlined in Uganda’s Vision 2040, Uganda’s aspirations hinge on uplifting the quality of life through transformation of Ugandan society from “a peasant to a modern and prosperous nation”. Along that path Uganda not only fulfils national obligations enshrined in its Constitution, but also responds to the agendas of a global instrument, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to which the country, like other signatories, is a Party.", 
"Uganda’s priority is to reduce the vulnerability of its population, environment and economy by implementing adaptation actions. Uganda also intends to “implement strategies, plans and actions for low greenhouse gas emission development” in the context of its development goals. These mitigation and adaptation intentions are based on the country’s National Climate Change Policy (NCCP) (2015), which is derived from the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda (1995, as amended in 2005 and 2015) and reflects Uganda Vision 2040 (2012). The priorities in the National Climate Change Policy have been integrated in the Second National Development Plan (NDP II) 2015/16 - 2019/2020 (2015). In the long term, Uganda intends to follow a climate-resilient and low-carbon development path linked to green growth and broader sustainable development goals.", 
"The economy of Uganda is highly depended on her natural resources, making the country vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Uganda is experiencing significant impacts of climate change, which include which include changing weather patterns, drop in water levels, and increased frequency of extreme weather events. The emissions of greenhouse gases resulting from human activities drives climate change. Even though Uganda’s emissions are low the country is fulfilling her obligations to contribute to the emission reductions, as reflected in goal 13 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.", 
"Uganda’s contribution to emission reduction is multidimensional, through tree planting, afforestation and reforestation programmes, and all these contribute to emission reduction through carbon sequestration, and other benefits, such as biodiversity conservation, as reflected in goal 15 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.", "Uganda’s response to submit her Intended Nationally Determined Contribution has various benefits across sectors. In the Energy sector, for example, the deficit experienced in the past decade drove the country into using unsustainable, expensive and polluting thermal generators (diesel and heavy-fuel oil). Uganda’s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution opens the door to affordable and modern energy as inscribed in goal seven of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs). Since 1960 mean annual temperatures have risen by 1.3ºC and annual and seasonal rainfall has decreased significantly across Uganda. Rainfall has also become more unpredictable and evenly distributed over the year. Extreme events such as droughts, floods and landslides are increasing in frequency and intensity.", 
"Climate change is affecting a wide variety of sectors. Agriculture, water, health and human settlements have been particularly affected. In the 2007-08 fiscal year, climate change damages were equivalent to 4.4% of the national budget, exceeding the budget allocation for the Environment and Natural Resource Sector.", "Climate projections developed for the country using the models used in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC AR5) indicate an increase in near-surface temperature for the country in the order of +2°C in the next 50 years, and in the order of +2.5°C in the next 80 years under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5; and in the order of +2.5°C in the next 50 years, and in the order of +4.5°C in the next 80 years under RCP 8.5. They also predict a slight decrease in total annual rainfall in most of the country, with slightly wetter conditions over the west and north-west under both RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. Rainfall totals might drop significantly over Lake Victoria (-20% from present).", 
"Recent studies, which require further refinement, have estimated that, in the absence of adaptation actions, the cost of the impacts of climate variability and change in Uganda would range between United States dollars 270 and 332 billion over the 40 year period 2010-2050, for the agriculture, water, infrastructure, and energy sectors. Annual costs could be in the range of United States dollars 3.2 billion to United States dollars $5.6 billion within a decade in these four sectors alone.", 
"The rural poor and those living in slums are especially vulnerable as they have lower capacity to cope with and adapt to the impacts of climate change. Women are especially vulnerable in terms of food insecurity, water shortage and fuel wood scarcity. Children, the elderly, and persons with disabilities or sick are also particularly vulnerable.", "Current and future impacts of climate change make adaptation urgent. As illustrated above, Uganda will continue to undertake adaptation initiatives. Uganda also intends to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improving climate change resilience and moving to a low-carbon future, and will rely on the cooperation between the Government of Uganda and other stakeholders. As explained above, the full implementation of the priority adaptation and mitigation strategies is conditional on accessing significant external support (70% of the additional financial resources required for the full implementation of this INDC are dependent on external support).", 
"So far international climate funds have played a very small role in climate change adaptation and mitigation in Uganda. Although a number of them have been active in the country over the last few years, levels of committed funding are not significant and they appear not to have been disbursed in many cases. Only around US$ 160,000 was disbursed over the period 2008/9 - 2011/12. Most of it has been directed at mitigation actions.", "In contrast, traditional development partners have committed substantial funds towards climate change-related activities in Uganda. The seventeen major adaptation projects that have been implemented since 2001 in partnership with the Government of Uganda add up to approximately US$ 59 million.", 
"Climate change-related initiatives will continue to be monitored. The effectiveness and efficiency of the implementation of the NCCP is to be monitored against its approved outcomes and outputs on an annual basis. Information from ministries, departments and agencies will be reported to the Ministry of Finance, Planning an Economic Development and copied to the National Planning Authority and the Climate Change Department, which will prepare a consolidated annual progress report. An independent evaluation is planned after the first five years of implementation of the NCCP. The recommendations will feed into the revision of the climate change policy, which should be informed by a thorough public consultation process.",

Adaptation to climate change", "2.1 Long-term goals", "Uganda has the overarching objective of ensuring that all stakeholders address climate change impacts and their causes through appropriate measures, while promoting sustainable development and green growth. The country will continue to work on reducing vulnerability in the following priority sectors: agriculture and livestock, forestry, infrastructure (with an emphasis on human settlements, social infrastructure and transport), water, energy and health.

Fairness, ambition and contribution towards achieving the objective of the Convention", 
"To develop a fair and ambitious contribution that helps achieve the objective of the Convention but recognises Uganda’s national circumstances as a Least Developed Country, Uganda has considered how it can prioritise those actions and measures that achieve emissions reductions while ensuring increased resilience and development outcomes for Uganda.", "As a Least Developed Country with low emissions and high vulnerability to climate impacts, Uganda’s ability to undertake climate action without external support is extremely low when compared to other countries.", 
"", "Uganda has one of the lowest greenhouse gas emissions per capita in the world, at approximately 1.39 Tons Carbon dioxide equivalent in 2011 (well below the global average of approximately 7.99 Tons Carbon dioxide equivalent and even below the average of Least Developed Countries of 3 tons Carbon dioxide equivalent );", "Uganda has contributed only 0.099% of the world’s total Greenhouse Gas emissions in 2011 (based on Climate Analysis Indicators Tool (CAIT) data); and", 
"Uganda’s capacity to undertake action is constrained by its national circumstances and development priorities. It has a human development index (HDI) Value of 0.477(compared to the global average of 0.698) and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of only 1,607 (2011 PPP $) (compared to the global average of 12,600 (2011 PPP $)).", "", "In light of these factors, Uganda’s contribution is both fair and ambitious. It prioritises specific measures in energy supply, forestry and wetlands to provide both Greenhouse Gas emission reductions as well as development benefits. As of 2011, only 15% of Uganda’s population had access to electricity. By committing to increase Uganda’s renewable energy generation capacity by 2030 and prioritising the construction of enabling infrastructure for the electricity sector, Uganda is not only reducing its emissions by approximately 3.2 Million tons Carbon dioxide equivalent per year , but also enabling greater access to reliable and sustainable energy for the 85% of Uganda’s population that live in rural areas, in turn, improving the livelihoods and health of rural populations.", 
"Uganda’s greatest mitigation potential is in the land use, land-use change and forestry sectors. Reversing the current deforestation trend (of approximately 14% in 2013) to increase forest cover to 21% in 2030 is highly ambitious considering that 89.5% of the country’s energy needs are currently met by charcoal and firewood. This commitment further highlights the holistic nature of Uganda’s contribution - recognising that the development of the electricity sector is key to achieving the reduction in wood and charcoal burning necessary to reduce deforestation.", 
"In addition, by focusing on these policies and measures, Uganda will also ensure alignment with its long-term adaptation goals in terms of forest protection, reduction of the energy deficit and resilient energy infrastructure. By structuring its contribution in this way, Uganda is able to contribute to the global efforts to reduce Greenhouse Gas emissions and contribute to the achievement of the objective of the Convention, while at the same time addressing domestic development needs and priorities.", 
"Despite the ambition of Uganda’s proposed contribution, additional assistance would enable Uganda to increase its resilience and realise greater Greenhouse Gas emissions reductions. Uganda’s contribution therefore includes a range of additional measures in key priority sectors based on the potential to reduce GHG emissions, provide development benefits and adaptation co-benefits. An example of one of these key sectors is agriculture. Approximately 80% of the population is directly reliant on the agricultural sector for their livelihood.

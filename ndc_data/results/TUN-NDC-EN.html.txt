"This document summarizes the intended nationally determined contributions (INDC) of Tunisia for the purposes of its submission to the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The report has been drawn up in accordance with decision 1/CP.20 (Lima call for climate action), which specifically draws attention, in paragraph 14, to the clarity, transparency and understanding of the INDC reports. It is based on important models and calculations of emissions reductions in various sectors, as well as ways of identifying and evaluating adaptation measures.", 
"The document was drafted through broad cooperation between the main stakeholders involved in the topic of climate change in Tunisia, including public institutions, the private sector and civil society. Tunisia’s contributions were also by and large developed on the basis of existing sectoral and horizontal strategies, such as the national climate change strategy, drawn up in 2012; the energy efficiency strategy; the Tunisian Solar Plan and the adaptation strategies of a range of sectors and fields (coast, agriculture, water resources, health, tourism, and so on).", 
"In its contribution, Tunisia proposes reducing its greenhouse gas emissions across all sectors (energy; industrial processes; agriculture, forestry and other land use; waste) in order to lower its carbon intensity by 41 per cent in 2030, relative to the base year 2010. Mitigation efforts will particularly centre on the energy sector, which alone accounts for 75 per cent of the emissions reductions contributing to this decrease in carbon intensity. As part of the energy transition policy advocated by the State, it is estimated that the energy sector will reduce its carbon intensity in 2030 by 46 per cent compared with 2010.", 
"Tunisia, which has already made significant strides towards mitigation in its baseline, is looking to reduce its carbon intensity unconditionally and through its own efforts by 13 per cent compared to 2010, i.e. by around 1/3 of its INDC. To achieve the rest of its objective, i.e. an additional drop in carbon intensity of 28 per cent in 2030 compared to 2010, Tunisia is relying on the support of the international community for funding, capacity building and technology transfer.", "The reduction in emissions compared to the baseline scenario would be in the order of 26 million tCO2eq in 2030, and 207 million tCO2eq for the period 2015-2030.", 
"Implementation of the Tunisian contribution towards mitigation requires substantial funds to be mobilized - an estimated 18 billion US dollars - to cover investment needs and finance capacity building programmes.", "The national effort required to achieve Tunisia’s unconditional contribution is estimated at nearly 10 per cent of the total mitigation investment needs. The national effort exclusively concerns the energy sector, which accounts for the most significant part of the investment needs.", 
"In terms of adaptation, Tunisia remains very vulnerable to the global warming anticipated in the region and the corresponding implications of major increases in temperature, reduced precipitation and rising sea levels. The socio-economic and environmental impact will particularly affect water resources, agriculture, natural and artificial ecosystems, the coastline, health and tourism.", "The additional costs of the necessary adaptation measures for these sectors and fields will come to some 2 billion dollars and should be borne completely by the international community as part of the global fight against climate change.", 
"Altogether, the total additional financing required for mitigation and adaptation would be around 20 billion US dollars to fund investment requirements and capacity building.", "1 National situation", "Tunisia is situated in North Africa, covering an area of some 164,000 km² and with a 1,300 km coastline on the Mediterranean Sea. The climate is particularly arid and variable, with precipitation ranging from 800 mm per year in the north to 150 mm per year in the south.", 
"Page 3", "The population growth rate has steadily been dropping, reaching 1 per cent per year during the past decade. Tunisia had some 11 million inhabitants in 2014, whereas it had 9.9 million in 2004.", "Tunisia is considered to be one of the countries most exposed to climate change in the Mediterranean. The main risks which it is likely to confront are temperature increases, reduced precipitation, rising sea levels and escalating extreme weather phenomena (floods and droughts). These risks are likely to result in major environmental and socio-economic vulnerability.", 
"Tunisia is aware of these challenges and has adopted a proactive policy of fighting climate change, both in terms of mitigation and adaptation.", "Moreover, as Tunisia actively supports international efforts to combat climate change, it has delivered on all of its commitments to the UNFCCC, the last of which was the submission of the first biennial report in December 2014.", "In addition, in the wake of the political changes triggered in December 2010, Tunisia adopted a new constitution on 26 January 2014, which incorporated the fight against climate change as a permanent feature. Under Article 44 of the new constitution, the State shall “provide the means necessary to guarantee a healthy and balanced environment and contribute to the climate’s integrity”.",

"", "To meet these challenges, the Tunisian authorities have decided, since 2013, to forge ahead with an energy transition process based on an unprecedented strengthening of the energy management agenda and its two pillars of energy efficiency and renewable energies. This transition agenda aims for a reduction in primary energy demand of 30 per cent by 2030 compared to the baseline scenario, and a penetration rate of 30 per cent for renewable energies in electricity production.", "Page 4",

This should allow primary energy demand to decrease by some 30 per cent by 2030 ,compared to the baseline.",

The carbon footprint for agriculture will also be improved by using practices that generate fewer emissions, such as optimizing the diets of domestic animals, promoting biological agriculture or conservation- oriented agricultural practices, or recovering energy from animal waste.", 
"Waste: The mitigation plan provides for the implementation, from 2016, of a plan to install facilities to transform solid waste into RDF (refuse derived fuel) introducing intended for cement facilities, as well as a programme for degasification systems in controlled landfills.

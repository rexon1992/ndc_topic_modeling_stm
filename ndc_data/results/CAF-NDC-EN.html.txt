The terrain consists of a vast peneplain dominated by two mountain ranges at its eastern and western ends joined by a central spine that separates the two principal drainages, the Chari-Longue basin in the north and the Congo basin in the south.", 
"The climate is hot and humid equatorial, characterised by two seasons: a dry season and a rainy season. The rainfall varies between 800 mm in the north and 1600 mm in the south and the average annual temperature varies between 15 °C in the south and 38 °C in the north. The future scenario indicates an increase in temperature on the order of 1.4 to 2.2°C, assuming low greenhouse gas emissions, and 1.8 to 2.7°C, assuming high greenhouse gas emissions. The forecasts regarding change in precipitation are less clear. Some forecasts predict a slight increase in annual precipitation, while others project irregular variations in precipitation. The extreme climate hazards, the probability of which could increase with climate change, are torrential rains followed by floods and droughts.", 
"From south to north, the biological diversity is composed of five large phytogeographic zones, each with a specific fauna: the Guinean forest zone of dense humid forests; the Sudano-Ubangian zone, sheltering dense semi-humid, open and dry forests; the Sudano-Guinean and Sudano-Sahelian zones, composed of various types of savannahs; and the Sahelian zone, consisting of steppes.", "The population of the Central African Republic is estimated at 5 million, with a demographic growth on the order of 2.5%/year. It is predominantly rural (62.1%), female (50.2%) and young (49.4% less than 18 years of age). The country is sparsely and unevenly populated. The average population density is 7.2 inhabitants per Km2. Decades of military and political crises have destroyed the nascent development and the last conflict of 2012-2013 spread insecurity throughout the population, destroyed the productive fabric and dismantled the administrative machinery.", 
"The Central African Republic is among the poorest countries on the planet, with a human development index estimated at 0.341 in 2013. Poverty affects more than half the population, with the corollaries of food insecurity and a lack of basic social services. The Central African economy still relies on a primary agricultural sector with low value added and intensive use of poorly qualified and essentially rural manpower. To the various internal constraints to the country’s development, including the low level of industrialisation and the land-locked nature of the country, are added the ongoing changes in the climate, which are reflected in different impacts: slow and gradual changes in the environment, variation in the seasons and on occasions extreme climate events (floods, droughts, tropical storms etc.) that may result in natural disasters.", 
"The annual emissions of the Central African Republic, estimated at 116,285.49 kt eq-CO2 in 2010, or 26 tons eq-CO2/person, represent less than 0.002% of global emissions. Despite its low rate of GHG emissions, the Central African Republic reaffirms its adherence to the principle of collective but differentiated responsibility and, in accordance with Decision 1CP/19, is taking the present ambitious measures to respond to this challenge without impeding its economic, social and environmental development.", 
"However, the vulnerability to changes in the climate and a lack of ability to adapt to their adverse impacts represent serious threats to the management of ecosystems and other agricultural and renewable natural resources, social cohesion, stability and sustainable development. Thus, the Central African Republic is obliged to take into account the adaptation of its land, its communities and its socioeconomic activities in this effort to contribute to the mitigation of climate change. The incorporation of an adaptation component in the INDC is thus a strategic choice that is vital to the country. Moreover, not only do most of the adaptation measures, particularly those that help deal with land use change and reduce the fundamentally non-remunerative nature of agriculture, also contribute to mitigation. However, the adaptation component, which concerns the poorest, most exposed and most vulnerable populations, is an occasion to promote throughout the national territory socioeconomic development on a fair and sustainable basis that can meet the challenges of improving access to the country and preventing inter-regional conflicts.", 
"The Central African Republic’s vision is “to become an emerging country, built upon an economy that is diversified, sustainable and uniformly shared throughout the national territory, a modern state open to the world and committed to an ethic and to technological innovation.” The general objectives of the Central African Republic’s INDC are focussed on sustainable, low-carbon development and growing resilience of the sectors of agriculture and food security, health, management of natural resources and infrastructure against the adverse effects of climate change.",

The inclusion of climate-sensitive agroecological approaches (smart agriculture) in the PNIASAN with a view to increasing productivity and yield may make it possible to keep each farmer on the same original parcel of land for five years, which will make it possible to minimise or complete avoid increases in area and thus capitalise the deforestation (28%) avoided over the four years following the start-up of the project.

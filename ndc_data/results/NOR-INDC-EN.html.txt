"The scientific basis for such assessment is the most recent assessment report by the IPCC. The 5th Assessment Report shows that scenarios that are likely to limit global warming below 2°C require that global emissions must be reduced by 40 to 70% by 2050 compared to 2010 levels. Norway’s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions of at least 40% by 2030 compared to 1990 is well in line with the emissions pathways towards 2050 that correspond to keeping global warming below 2°C. Thus, Norway is doing its fair share for the global goal of keeping global warming below 2°C compared to pre-industrial levels. This is consistent with industrialised countries taking the lead.", 
"An emission reduction target of 40% by 2030 compared to 1990 is at the high end of emission reductions that should be implemented by OECD-countries, given a global cost-effective, regional distribution of emission reduction targets (IPCC WGIII, table 6.4).", "Under the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, Norway is committed to an emission reduction corresponding to average annual emissions over the period 2013-2020 at 84 per cent of the 1990 emission level. The commitment under KP 2 is consistent with the Norwegian target of 30 per cent reduction of emissions by 2020, compared to 1990. Norway’s INDC represents a significant progression beyond current undertaking. Given a successful outcome where the commitment is implemented through a collective delivery with the EU, the overall emission reduction will take place within Europe.",

In the base year, net removals in the sector was 10.1 Mt CO2-equivalents, while the projected net removals in 2030 constitute 21.2 Mt CO2-equivalents. Removals beyond the level in the base year and the projected level will count towards the 40% commitment. This will constitute additional action in the land sector. When the difference of 11.1 Mt between the base year level and the projected level is included, the commitment would need to be recalculated to ensure that the ambition level stays unchanged. Net removals in the base year and the projection may be adjusted as a consequence of improved emission inventory data in future national GHG inventory submissions. ↩",

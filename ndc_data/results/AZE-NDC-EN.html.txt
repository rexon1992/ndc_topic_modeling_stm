"The Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict resulted in the occupation of 20% of the territory of Azerbaijan by Armenia and the inflow of a million refugees and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs). In addition, the conflict inflicted heavy damage on the environment of Azerbaijan. 1.7 million hectares of land that currently remain under Armenian occupation are comprised of 595.6 thousand hectares of agricultural land, 247.4 thousand hectares of forest area and 10.1 thousand hectares of farmland. 247.352 hectares of forest area, including 13197.5 hectares of rare and valuable forests, 152 natural monuments and 5 geological objects located in the occupied territories have been destroyed. Large scale arsons regularly committed by the Armenian military forces in the occupied territories seriously damage environment and livelihoods in adjacent districts as well as in the entire region. The inflicted damage amounts to billions of US dollars.",

Introduction", "France will host the 21st Conference of Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21/CMP21), which will take place in Paris in December 2015 and should result in a new international agreement on the climate that is applicable to all countries. The entire international community expects this agreement to be universal and lasting. It should give the economic and political signals for our planet’s economic development model to set out on a new path leading to carbon neutrality before the end of the century and to observance of the 2°C objective (i.e. keeping global warming at temperatures below +2°C).", 
"The principal goal of COP21, from November 30 to December 11, 2015, is to conclude an agreement that will commit 195 countries to reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The end objective is for the contributions by these countries (which vary from country to country) to make it possible to stabilise climate warming due to human activities below 2°C between now and 2100 (in comparison to the pre-industrial era). Each country will renew its commitments to the Climate Change Convention (UNFCCC) in a document called Intended Nationally Determined Contributions or INDC (CPDN in French) between now and the end of October 2015.",

The current commitments are part of the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol - notably the case of the European Union – or correspond to voluntary national actions under the Copenhagen agreement and the Cancun accords.", "Fairness and differentiation: The contributions are examined in light of the national circumstances of each country. The least developed countries (LDCs) and the small island developing states (SIDS) benefit especially from a certain degree of flexibility in preparing their INDC in view of their limited capabilities.", 
"Transparency: The contributions reported by the countries are published as they are readily available on the UNFCCC site. A synthesis report of all the parties’ contributions will be presented by the UNFCCC secretariat on November 1, 2015, on the basis of the INDC’s received as of October 1st.", "", "2.2. National strategies and policies, a sustainable development framework", 
"Burkina Faso’s National Assembly on the Environment and Sustainable Development, held in November 2011, strongly recommended the development of a National Sustainable Development Policy (NSDP) accompanied by a law. Prepared in 2013, the NSDP was an effective framework for the Strategy for Accelerated Growth and Sustainable Development (SAGSD). This economic framework document, together with “Outlook Burkina 2025” and policy framework instruments, contribute to place the concept of sustainability at the heart of public action and the activities of other non-state actors (technological and financial partners, civil society organisations, non-governmental organisations and the private sector) in a socioeconomic development drive that generates growth and fairly distributes revenues in the medium and long term in climatically high-vulnerability sectors such as those identified in National Communication 2.", 
"2.3. Organisations and programs put in place for adaptation and mitigation", "Burkina Faso ratified the UNFCCC in 1993 and the Kyoto Protocol in 2005. Up to now, in response to the provisions of these protocols, it has developed and adopted a number of policy and strategy documents relating to climate change. These include:", "", "The National Strategy for implementing the Climate Change Convention adopted in 2001.", 
"The National Action Program for Adaptation to Climate Change (NAPA) in 2007.", "The development of a framework NAMA (2008).", "The National Adaptation Plan (NAP, 2014).", "", "To address and follow up climate change issues, a Permanent Secretariat of the National Council for Management of the Environment (SP/CONAGECE) was created within the ministry responsible for the environment and which will subsequently be transformed into the National Council for the Environment and Sustainable Development (SP/CONEDD) with expanded responsibilities.", 
"In 1995, Burkina Faso established the Inter-Ministerial Committee to Implement the Actions of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (IMCIAC). This committee has been fully involved in the preparation of the first National Communication on climate change.", "2.3.1 From NAPA to NAP", "Faced with the degradation of the ecosystems, the recurrence of food crises and the adverse impacts of climate change on the environment, populations and livestock, the Government of Burkina Faso, with the support of the UNDP as the executive agency for the World Environmental Fund (WEF), initiated in 2005 the formulation of its National Action Program for Adaptation to climate change and variability. The NAPA was adopted at the national level in 2007. In this context and under the leadership of SP/CONEDD, three adaptation projects were developed and carried out between 2008 and 2013 with the support of Denmark and Japan and the World Environmental Fund (WEF). Thus, NAPA responded to an urgent situation in which adaptation was principally directed to those who are most vulnerable, particularly rural populations.", 
"Building on the achievements of the NAPA, on the one hand, and, on the other, to initiate a comprehensive medium- and long-term approach to adaptation to climate change and expand the national process to all of the stakeholders in development, Burkina embarked on the process to develope a National Adaptation Plan (NAP) structured around the results of analysing the vulnerability to climate change of the sectors identified as priority (agriculture, livestock breeding, water, forests and natural ecosystems, energy, infrastructure and housing, health etc.) and climate change scenarios in the 2025-2050 time period.", 
"2.3.2 The need for a NAMA framework", "The need for quantitative evaluation of the mitigation potential led Burkina Faso to develop a NAMA framework in 2008, in this case the National Rural Sector Program (NRSP). The NRSP is part of the drive for short, medium and long-term development programming carried out through the Outlook Burkina 2025 study, the development of the National Land-Use Planning Scheme (NLUPS) and, more recently (2010), the adoption of the Strategy for Accelerated Growth and Sustainable Development (SAGSD), which replaced the Anti-Poverty Strategic Framework (APSF).", 
"The NRSP, which targeted the year 2015, is a federation of sectoral programs of the departments of agriculture, livestock raising, water, the environment and quality of life. Within this framework, the mitigation potential for the period 2008-2015 was estimated at 9,174,816 eq.t.CO2 of GHG, or 1,200,000 eq.t.CO2 per year.", "The proposed mitigation measures contribute to the achievement of the Government’s objective, i.e. the restoration of degraded land at the rate of 30,000 ha/yr, the increase of natural forests from 170,00 to 500,000 ha, the reduction of forest areas burned by wildfires from 30% of the national territory to 20%, the development of village hunting areas through the awareness and training of the population, and the spread of knowledge regarding techniques for sustainable management of natural resources.", 
"2.3.3 The Second National Communication", "Pursuant to article 4 and 12 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Burkina Faso developed a National Communication containing the measures aimed at mitigation or appropriate adaptation to climate change. In this context, a Second National Communication was developed in 2014 in accordance with the directives of decision 17/CP 8 adopted by the eighth session of the Conference of Parties to the UNFCCC. Since the process of its development began after 2006, the inventory data was based on the data for 2007 as the reference year. Pointing out the changes in climate, the Second National Communication completes and updates certain data already brought to the attention of the international community in the initial Communication of 2001, which the UNFCCC web site refers to May 2002.", 
"2.4. The peculiarities of Burkina Faso’s INDC", "The INDC of Burkina Faso, a weak emitter country, is one of the few that have both characteristics of the INDCs, namely an outcomes approach and an actions/projects/activities approach.", "This results in a Mitigation component that has taken into consideration only the activities that lead to credited emission results, the objectives of which have been oriented from the start toward the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and in particular the carbon equivalent. One example of these initiatives is represented by the REDD + / FIP, the NAMA initiative and the potential CDM projects in the growth sectors such as mining. These initiatives, dedicated principally to the reduction of greenhouse gas, make up the Conditional Hybrid Mitigation / (Adaptation) scenario.", 
"Furthermore, Burkina’s INDC contains an Adaptation component that makes this INDC somewhat unique and ambitious since the analysis of the adaptation options with their special investments and “vulnerable” sectors to the search for resilience has led to an Integrated Adaptation Scenario. It is from this component that the projects/activities/actions approach emerges. It is strongly justified by the fact that the “rural sector”, consisting of the water-agriculture-forest-land use subsectors, is at the same time the principal engine of the Burkina economy (it provides the livelihood of more than 80% of the population) and the sector most vulnerable to the effects of climate change.", 
"Thus, this component consists of projects whose objective is not PRINCIPALLY the reduction of GHG (mainly through carbon sequestration), but the enhancement of environmental services such as food security, water and soil conservation, sustainable agriculture, the development of non-ligneous forest products, including medicinal plants, the promotion of wood and metal free architecture (“Nubian vaults”), etc. As a bonus to the mitigation component, these projects result in the medium and long term in considerable reductions of GHG, which even exceed the results of mitigation efforts.", 
"Section 3. Mitigation projections and options", "3.1. Methodology", "The “Mitigation” team carried out its work on the basis of the following methodology:", "", "Use of the 2007 GHG inventory by sector (i.e. agriculture; energy, including the transportation sector; waste; industrial processes; land use; land use changes and forestry (LULUCF).", "Determination of the socioeconomic indicators for the “Business as Usual (BaU)” scenario for the GHG emissions projection at the 2030 horizon.", 
"Construction of GHG emissions projection scenarios by sector.", "Identification of mitigation actions that is underway or scheduled, by sector.", "Analysis of the impacts of adaptation actions (if any) in order to integrate their indirect emission reductions in the mitigation outcome.", "Evaluation of the Burkina Faso contribution in terms of mitigation.", "Recommendations for mitigation actions by sector.", "Coverage level of the contribution: the scenarios are based on data covering the entire national territory.", 
"", "This methodology is reflected in the report as follows:", "", "A GHG outcome approach offering the greatest flexibility in the way of reaching the GHG reductions, without necessarily specifying all of the actions the emissions reduction will entail. This approach permits transparency in the calculations and projections and assures that the progress achieved with regard to the actions will be better monitored since the GHG targets generally take into consideration the baseline (2014) national GHG inventory and more specifically the most detailed possible sector data.", 
"As a result of point 1, the Government could commit itself to quantified results capable of providing better understanding of the future emissions reductions and the emissions levels associated with the contributions, which, when combined, facilitates an evaluation of future emissions (conditional mitigation and adaptation scenario). These global results also permit progress in carrying out INDC follow-through and offer greater credibility for the purpose of receiving financing and accessing markets, as well as improving comparison between the INDC’s. It is also simpler to estimate the effects and co-benefits under the GHG outcome approach and/or the GHG actions approach.", 
"In the Burkina Faso INDC, both approaches have been used: outcomes in most cases for mitigation and outcomes and projects (actions) for adaptation.", "Thus, this results in three scenarios: one BaU scenario, one unconditional scenario and one conditional scenario that includes the adaptation project whose main objective is the reduction of “credited” GHGs.", "The Mitigation section presents these three scenarios and their descriptions by key sectors with respect to GHG contributions, while at the same time attempting to keep the same key sectors throughout the analysis of the three scenarios and also in the Adaptation section and the socioeconomic section. The rest of the sectors are used only to provide an investment cost if the secondary projects/actions are asked to contribute to an even greater GHG reduction at different horizons up to 2030 (compared to 2015).",

The only scenario to be prepared for is the trend situation, “business as usual”, because the climate effects which Burkina must confront have already begun and the positive effects of the possible mitigation actions to be envisaged from this point forward, either at the local or global level, will not be felt until after the period of applicability of the INDC (2030).",

Economic and financial options for mitigation and adaptation projects", "The adaptation and mitigation options in the case of a developing country such as Burkina Faso are a complex function of multiple factors, the most important of which are: (i) the cost of technology, (ii) the ease of applying or adopting the technology, (iii) the social benefit and (iv) the abundance of the consumption factor (or raw materials that can be used by technology).", 
"Since the financial factor is the constraining determinant, in particular for investment projects of a nature that is more social than economic, the analysis of the implementation of mitigation and adaptation projects places greater emphasis on cost factors (implementation of the technology) than on other factors.", "Thus, a country such as Burkina Faso, so long as the mitigation constraints are not too high (as is the case for developed countries with high-intensity emissions), must gauge its projects by the order of increasing project implementation costs.", 
"Hence, three options are possible:", "", "Option 1: Mitigation and adaptation projects that can be carried out at negative cost.", "Option 2: Policies/measures/projects that can be carried out at net negative or zero cost, taking into consideration the associated social, economic and environmental benefits.", "Option 3: Mitigation projects with a positive cost that are feasible on condition of receiving international assistance.", "", "5.1.1 Mitigation and adaptation projects that can be carried out at a negative cost (BaU scenario)", 
"Negative-cost projects are defined as investments that produce economies of scale sufficient to cover invested capital, maintenance, operating costs and interest charges throughout the life cycle of the project. This option is desirable in all the mitigation and adaptation scenarios, but especially in the BaU (Business as Usual) or unconditional scenarios, because of the certainty that each project that is invested in will give its investors a return, particularly where there is no outside support or where the investment is made through domestic borrowing.", 
"In the mitigation area, reforestation and stove improvement projects can generate negative costs. Indeed, association with the Carbon Fund can provide financial benefits that may compensate for or counterbalance the amounts invested to implement the projects, in such a way as to make the project costs negative.", "5.1.2 Policies/measures/projects that can be carried out at net negative or zero cost, taking into consideration the associated social, economic and environmental benefits (equivalent to the Unconditional Scenario)", 
"It is sometimes difficult to determine the quantitative and monetary benefits of a social policy. The difficulty of extrapolating social or environmental gains as financial gains explains the difficulty in understanding negative or zero costs. The projects within this option have an absolute financial value that is negative, but an overall absolute value that is zero or positive when one takes into account the economic and productive, public health and environmental effects that they produce. Their implementation is optional in the context of the unconditional and current trend (BaU) scenarios.", 
"The examples of obvious interest concern the “improved cook stove” and &quot;advanced cook stove projects.", "5.1.3 Mitigation projects with a positive cost that are feasible on condition of international assistance (equivalent to the Hybrid Conditional receiving Scenario)", "These projects, the principal objective of which is generally the mitigation and reduction of GHG (MPD, REDD+ NAMA projects), are of two types and relate to investments that are feasible in the context of the conditional (external financing) scenario:", 
"", "", "The project is very costly and profitable at a certain scale because of the economies of scale it will generate, but external support would be needed because of its high investment cost.", "", "", "The project is not financially profitable, but its economic, public health and environmental benefits are significant and its implementation would almost necessarily require external financial assistance because of its high cost.", "", "", "5.1.4 Relationships between economic options and mitigation and adaptation options", 
"When investments in mitigation and adaptation projects are financially profitable, the country does not need an external contribution because the invested capital is going to be recovered and the investors will get back their investment. This type of project is to be financed and carried out in a BaU or unconditional scenario through financing provided by the central government along with its local partners (including the private sector in the context of domestic borrowing).", "However, if a project is not financially profitable (but nevertheless has enormous socioeconomic impacts or co-benefits), or even profitable with enormous socioeconomic impacts or co-benefits, the investments will be made within the framework of a hybrid conditional scenario, i.e. the requirement for external or international support to finance the project.", 
"An example of the type of project within the framework of a conditional scenario, where the financing requires external financial support, is the “improved cook stoves” project.", "Improved cook stoves for which the performance varies as a function of technological innovations (improved cook stove or advanced cook stove), will yield more or less positive financial profitability as a function of their use (households or producers). In the case of household use for domestic needs, the profitability is less, while in the case of use to produce dolo (sorghum beer), the profitability is much greater.", 
"Nevertheless, in both modes of use, the impacts and co-benefits of using the improved cook stove are enormous:", "", "", "Use of the improved cook stove makes it possible to save 15% to 45% of the energy used in cooking, depending on the level of technology. This means that in the above cases, the destruction of biomass is 15% to 45% less, which is of broad large-scale significance.", "", "", "The cooking speed resulting from the use of an improved cook stove allows the user of the stove to save 50% to 75% of the original time devoted to cooking or producing dolo (depending on how much the improved cook stove is used). This means that the user of the cook stove can devote more than half of the original time to other profitable activities and thus increase his or her income.", 
"", "", "The use of improved cook stoves permits households and other users to reduce their exposure to respiratory diseases caused by smoke or the inhalation of carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide, as the case may be. Persons previously exposed increase their health “capital” and the income previously devoted to health care is saved.", "", "", "Thus, because of the enormous associated benefits cited above, such projects are financed within the framework of a conditional scenario, with the need for external financial help.",

Sources and conditions of financing", "There are multiple sources for financing projects within the INDC.", "The availability of financing sources will depend on the ability of Burkina Faso to develop active cooperation with financing partners and institutions. To finance adaptation and mitigation projects, Burkina Faso could rely on access to the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and on the availability of the Environmental Action Fund created by the government, provided that this fund conforms to the rules of transparency, neutrality and good governance that permit a GCF window to be created within them.", 
"The strengthening of bilateral relations with friendly countries and multilateral relations with institutions such as the World Bank, the European Union, the GEF, the UNDP, the UNEP, the ADB, the IDB, the BOAD, the ECOWAS or WAEMU, all potential financial partners for the various projects through funds already in place, may permit Burkina Faso to finance these projects within the framework of climate change and international agreements and conventions.", "The Burkina Faso private sector will contribute a large part (almost 50% of the financing) on condition that the commercial banks are made aware of these types of financing.", 
"Burkina Faso supports the use of market mechanisms such as the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) as an effective monitoring, reporting and verification tool for mitigation activities and an instrument for results-oriented financing. Thus, Burkina Faso supports the use of certified emission reduction units (CER’s) delivered by CDM project, programmes and activities to reach the pre-2020 mitigation goals. Hence, payments for carbon such as to make this economically viable in the specific context of the less advanced countries, the developing countries and the small developing island states is a priority. To do this, the establishment of new accounting rules within the framework of the UNFCCC is necessary to guarantee the environmental integrity of market mechanisms and avoid double counting. These accounting rules will also be introduced for the EIF in order to achieve the required financial transparency.", 
"Section 6. Implementation and monitoring and evaluation of projects listed within the INDC", "6.1. Implementation system and actors", "The implementation of the projects listed within the INDC will require the establishment of an INDC Coordination Unit to report to the SP-CONEDD.[1] The Coordination Unit will be responsible for coordinating and supervising (monitoring) the implementation of the various actions identified in the INDC and will consist of three technical entities:", 
"", "A coordination entity responsible for scheduling the implementation activities of the various projects.", "A Technical Adaptation Cell that will be concerned with coordinating the implementation and follow-up of the adaptation projects and which could become a Designated National Authority for Adaptation (DNA-AD).", "A Technical Mitigation Cell that will be concerned with coordinating the implementation and follow-up of the mitigation projects in coordination with or on behalf of the Burkina Faso DNA (Designated National Authority).", 
"", "The staff and experts within these units will cooperate closely with the staffs of the various ministries in charge of the projects, which are:", "", "The Ministry of Agriculture", "The Ministry of Water Resources", "The Ministry of Animal Resources", "The Ministry of Environment and Forests", "The ministry and public institutions responsible for scientific research and technological innovation", "The Ministry of Housing and Urban Development", 
"The Ministry of Health", "The Ministry of Energy", "The Ministry of Transportation", "", "The Coordination Unit will work with the above departments and other cross-cutting ministries, such as the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the Ministry of the Promotion of Women and Gender and the Ministry of International Cooperation, within the framework of the financing agreements. Finally, it will coordinate with the civil society structures and the institutions representing the private sector.", 
"6.2. Follow-up and evaluation system and actors", "The Coordination Unit will be responsible for overall follow-up of the implementation activities of the INDC[2]. For this purpose, it will have to have a manual of administrative procedures and a harmonised system of follow-up and evaluation of the projects, detailing the principal responsibilities and the objectives that have been assigned.", 
"The project evaluation actors are external and will come from the technical and financial partners of the projects to be implemented. These evaluations will take place annually or at given intervals and, at certain stages in the implementation of the projects, will consider the work of the independent evaluators.", "Section 7. Conclusion", "In Burkina Faso’s INDC, the mitigation and adaptation themes have been integrated, the two of them being closely linked: to “mitigate” it is necessary in principle to “adapt” since the agriculture-forestry- land use (AFOLU) sector is an emission sector but also a major sequestration sector. Consequently, adaptation contributes to a great extent to mitigation revenues (CO2 sequestration and emissions avoided x the price per ton of carbon on the exchanges).", 
"However, adaptation necessitates substantial funding. Although the price per ton of CO2 has collapsed on the global markets, the reduction of CO2 emissions remains an excellent indicator of the performance and impact of the mitigation programmes and projects in Burkina Faso. But CO2 is not the only source of life in Burkina Faso (food security, atmospheric pollution, air and water quality). One molecule of water (H2O) is just as vital to the soil as CO2 for food security and the life cycle chain. For adaptation, the conservation of water (H2O) (runoff water, groundwater etc.) is an adaptation indicator just as CO2 is in the case of mitigation. Therefore, CO2 and H2O can both be counted, CO2 for its market value and H2O for its economic value.", 
"In the case of mitigation (approach and results), and for the purpose of reducing carbon emissions and increasing sequestration, the three scenarios are clear and obvious. The issue is to prioritise these scenarios by linking them to investments in adaptation, clean technology and projects whose end objective is a society with low carbon emissions and a greener rural world.", "In the case of adaptation, the options are above all varied and it is also necessary to prioritise them in a summary table based on mitigation projections, adaptation options and the investments required. For example, adaptation in the area of water resource management is multi-sectoral, with initiatives to conserve this resource with regard to both quality and quantity. In addition, collection, recycling, reuse, water treatment technologies and innovative schemes for water efficiency and good water management would aid to the “clarity” of this water. Other ideas would form part of the Strategic Framework for Investment in Sustainable Land Management (SFI-SLM), with a budget of 869 billion CFA francs for five years that is both ambitious and conservative. With one-third of the land degraded and thus 9,316,000 ha in distress, the application of good land use practices and the sustainable management of land are also required, given that these funds affect directly the people who are the most vulnerable (the users of these lands) and the fact that this activity directly attacks the problem of management of natural resources at all levels. Thus, developing an Integrated Adaptation Scenario for this INDC is ambitious.", 
"In terms of co-benefits, and in order to maximise them, the regions of the north and the animal husbandry sector will need more attention and greater investments. Here also, as in the forests sector, the mitigation and adaptation actions operate both symbiotically and in parallel.", "Climate change will amplify their impacts where there is already population pressure, that is in the heavily populated urban areas.", "The G7 countries have committed to contribute 100 billion dollars per year from now to 2020 to the fight against climate change, part of which is to pass through the Green Climate Fund (GCF).", 
"This sum promised by the international community is to support the developing countries in the limitation of their greenhouse gas emissions and their adaptation to the effects of climate change. However, this commitment does not cover all that is needed to finance worldwide reduction of greenhouse gases, an amount estimated at between 650 billion and 1,950 billion US dollars per year. Burkina Faso through its INDC should position itself among the community of nations to have access to these funds.", 
"In terms of financing, the Environmental Intervention Fund (EIF) established by Burkina Faso appears to be an excellent tool provided that the operating rules of this fund are flexible and transparent in a way to make it a tool of good governance. The income from emissions reductions could be paid into this fund. And since adaptation is at the heart of mitigation and gives rise to it, one could logically imagine that a percentage of the mitigation revenues would be mobilised to finance the adaptation options (up to 75%, for example), depending on the innovative mechanisms. One could also imagine more broadly that a percentage of the EIF (40%) would go to implement adaptation and mitigation measures (15%), cutting-edge follow-up and evaluation/certification technologies (15%) and applied research (10%, for example).", 
"From the beginning, Burkina Faso’s INDC was intended to be participative, particularly workshops 1 to 3 and the ad hoc working group, robust, fair, ambitious and transparent, not to mention other qualifiers.", "The INDC is robust because of its range of data, multiple analyses, summary tables and in-depth thinking on the environment, climate change, mitigation and adaptation, and social and socioeconomic areas and in the scenarios that give meaning to such thinking.", 
"To be fair and engender fairness, the INDC was intended to demonstrate to the community of nations that, despite this country’s low emissions of carbon and GHG in comparison to worldwide emissions, Burkina Faso assumes responsibility for the emissions it emits, particularly in the AFOLU sector. To do this, despite the fact the cost of reducing emissions and the ratio of investment cost to benefit (health, social benefits, food security) are high in Burkina, the government fully intends to undertake major mitigation actions in the energy sector and adaptation actions in the rural sector and the sectors of health and housing in order to help reduce its emissions, while significantly reducing the vulnerability of the strategic sectors of its economy.", 
"The INDC is ambitious because it goes beyond the BaU scenario and moves toward two other scenarios, Unconditional and Hybrid Conditional that integrate mitigation with adaptation. In the Unconditional Scenario, Burkina explores new targets and presses hard for the mitigation opportunities that the country would be expected to have if it took the technical and economic measures necessary to achieve ambitious economic growth to follow an upward curve that has still not been achieved in all sectors of development. In this Hybrid Conditional Scenario, Burkina Faso moves toward sustainable development. And the Integrated Adaptation Scenario lends itself well to transforming the resource consumption economy of Burkina Faso into a gradually green (or almost green) economy and into a society with low carbon emissions. In this scenario, it is estimated that the total value of the environmental services provided by the actions that are proposed in the AFOLU sectors over the 15 years up to 2030 would be at least US $11,500,000,000, which would give a return on investment of more than 400% (which, when compared with the solely financial return of primary production of 64%, is six times greater). These environmental services, although invisible in a consumption economy measured in GDP, are real in a circular or natural capital economy and contribute greatly to the national economy.", 
"While being fair and ambitious, the INDC aims to be transparent and aspires to reach the objectives of the Climate Convention by aligning itself with the 2°C objective and taking into consideration the need to limit cumulative emissions over this period to almost zero. Once again, this objective is ambitious and requires total transparency. Technically and economically, this means for Burkina Faso an economy with low carbon output (a low carbon emission society) and a country covered with green and with a green economy. With its semi-arid nature and climate conditions that are still more uncertain in the years to come, this transformation will demand considerable efforts and huge investments in adaptation, particularly in the agriculture-forests-land use (AFOLU) sectors. The adaptation solutions exist to help the population foresee and prepare to face the effects of climate change that will inevitably arise because of the GHG emissions that have already taken place since 1900.", 
"As it turns out, many adaptation actions rely on clean technologies that in turn contribute to the lowering of GHG emissions. The most important are connected with land management and the conservation of water, soil and forests in order to increase the resilience of the population. It is thus important that the government, its partners and international donors support these initiatives and make possible, through reasonable and proper investments, their greatest possible spread throughout the country.", 
"Section 8. Commitments / recommendations", "Burkina Faso’s commitment comes about through three scenarios.", "A first scenario, Unconditional (annex 1), the objective of which is to reduce GHG emissions by 7,808 Gg per year in 2030, i.e. 6% when compared to BaU, for ongoing investments of US $1.25 billion.", "A Hybrid Conditional scenario (annex 1), which aims to reduce GHG emissions by 11.6%, which corresponds to 13,766 Gg per year in 2030, for investments of US $756,032,667.", 
"A third scenario, Adaptation (annexe 2), which aims, among other things, to restore and develop 5,055 million ha of degraded lands at the 2030 horizon, corresponding to 55% of the total current area of degraded lands in the country and making it possible to feed more than 6 million additional persons at the 2030 horizon. Moreover, these adaptation projects will contribute to a reduction in GHG emissions of 43,707 Gg of CO2, i.e. 36.95% when compared to BaU, for an overall investment of US $5,804,949,915.", 
"The recommendations may be summarised as:", "", "Guarantee the use of the Environmental Intervention Fund, the financial transparency of which will be beyond question, to receive and distribute the receipts from the sale of carbon resulting from mitigation.", "Clearly promote renewable energy, at least by eliminating fossil fuel subsidies and, at best, by subsidising investments in renewable energy.", "Promote architectural structures that use materials that are local, renewable and insulating and have a low energy cost for all public construction and, through subsidies and tax breaks, for private residences.", 
"In the agricultural sector at large, move resolutely toward sustainable and adapted agricultural practices, particularly for family operations and small producers.", "For the large private and public farms, review the value chain in terms of climate change and, in particular, evaluate in the most rigorous and complete way the new biotechnology programmes, especially GMO’s.", "", "Section 9.

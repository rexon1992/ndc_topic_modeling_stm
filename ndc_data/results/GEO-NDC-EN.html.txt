According to the Third National Communication of Georgia to the UNFCCC, GHG emissions from Georgia in 2011 constituted 16,036 KtCO2eq which is 34% of 1990 emissions level (47,975 KtCO2eq).", 
"Economic growth will be accompanied by increase in GHG emissions (if no efforts are made to reduce GHG emissions associated). Therefore, it is important to undertake efforts to substantially limit this increase by boosting investments in low carbon technologies throughout the country.", "In 2010 Georgia acceded to the Copenhagen Accord and declared that “Georgia will take steps to achieve a measurable, reportable and verifiable deviation from the baseline scenario (below “business as usual” levels) supported and enabled by finance, technology and capacity- building”.",

The preparation of LEDS was launched in 2013 and is expected to be finalized in 2016. Georgia’s INDC is largely based on currently available results achieved during the LEDS preparation process. The final LEDS and the mitigation actions specified therein will become key instrument in achieving Georgia’s GHG emission reduction target.",

The NEEAP will document the plans for implementation of energy efficiency measures which have significant mitigation potential for the period before 2020 and beyond. It is envisaged that the most intensive pre-2020 mitigation action in Georgia should be the voluntary reduction of GHG emissions committed by thirteen self-governing cities and municipalities joining the EU initiative “Covenant of Mayors” (CoM). Further facilitation of this initiative will significantly contribute to post -2020 implementation processes.Three Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMA) are under preparation and, in case of international support, are expected to be implemented prior to 2020.

(f) Rising temperatures, increased winds and reduced water availability have significantly declined agricultural productivity.", 
"In case of a 2°C or higher increase in global warming, effects will become more severe in the future. This will create an extra burden on the development of society. Accordingly, adaptation to the adverse impacts of climate change is one of the main priorities for the Government of Georgia. The National Adaptation Plan will be prepared in order to further advance the implementation of adaptation actions. The main objective of the Government of Georgia is to improve country’s preparedness and adaptive capacity by developing climate resilient practices that reduce vulnerability of highly exposed communities. In this regard, Georgia takes steps to integrate climate risk and resilience into core development planning and implementation.", 
"Georgia’s agricultural sector plays a key role in the country’s economy. Georgian farmers are going to fulfill a principal role in providing one of the fundamental needs of society: a safe, secure, and affordable food supply. This underlines the importance of the relationship between climate change impacts on agriculture and food security. During last decades negative consequences of climate change have drastically reduced agricultural productivity. For example, severe drought in 2000 has reduced the production of cereals close to zero; due to the prolonged drought almost 400,000 hectares of agricultural lands have been damaged. Within the last decade the occurrence of droughts in Eastern Georgia increased, the severe droughts have been observed every year accompanied with high temperatures (40-42⁰) doubling the frequency of the occurrence of the intense droughts in the region.", 
"For the adaptation of agricultural sector to the expected climate change, wide range of measures is planned. Those include, but are not limited to the following: (a) research and development of emergency response plans for agriculture dealing with droughts, floods, etc; (b) Introduction of innovative irrigation management and water application techniques; (c) implementation of various site specific anti-erosion measures; (d) establishment of information centers for farmers that provides guidance on adaptive management of agriculture; etc.", 
"A complex mountainous topography makes the country more prone to the climate extremes and related events. Georgia is vulnerable to natural hazards including floods, flash floods, droughts, landslides, avalanches, and mud flows. Many of these extreme events have been recorded in the last two-three decades, the most recent one happening on the 13th of June 2015 in Tbilisi. The flash-flood was distinctive not only due to the high casualty (19 people dead and huge economic loss (around 100 million USD) but reconnecting to the fact that it was characterized by 9 different types of hydro-meteorological and geological extremes, occurring simultaneously within a very limited area. These weather extremes additionally result in changing of the hydrology of rivers, posing a serious impact on continuous water availability for drinking, irrigation and energy. Establishment of Early warning systems for climate related extreme events is considered as priority measure by the Government of Georgia.", 
"Sea level rise impacts are projected to induce multiple negative consequences in coastal zone of Georgia. It is imperative to assess and implement adaptation measures in order to minimize economic losses. Combination of various coastal zone protection technologies are recommended by the second “Technology Needs Assessment” report of Georgia to prevent the significant damage caused by the Black Sea level rise. According to the National communications of Georgia to the UNFCCC costs of the coastline adaptation program is estimated about 600 million USD. In absence of adaptation measures the estimated losses only in the tourism sector will reach about 2 billion USD by 2030. Due to very high social costs involved, priority will be given to the integrated coastal planning and management instruments, rather than investments in coastal erosion abatement only.",

Accessing finance that allows Georgia to adapt to the impacts of climate change is crucial. To estimate required financial support the following pre-2020 activities are planned: (a) prioritize selected adaptation policies and measures based on national circumstances and identify associated financial needs; (b) evaluate domestic sources of finances; and (c) determine need and sources for external financial support.",

In this regard technologies for the protection of coastal infrastructure; technologies for sustainable water management; sustainable agricultural technologies; and technologies for sustainable forest management are prioritized.", "The implementation of adaptation actions for the period 2021 - 2030 requires the continuous development and strengthening of Georgia’s capacities, in particular: (a) national capacity to develop adaptation strategies; (b) policy makers capacity for climate change adaptation planning; (c) capacity of communities to reduce their vulnerability to adverse impacts of future climate hazards; (d) capacity of national health system institutions, to respond to and manage long-term climate change-sensitive health risks.",

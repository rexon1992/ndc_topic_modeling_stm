"To influence and participate in establishing carbon-lean, climate-compatible development at the sub-regional and regional levels.", "", "", "", "INTRODUCTION ", "Togo has historically emitted little in the way of greenhouse gases and so has only had a very small part to play in the current climate crisis. However, it must already contend with the harmful consequences of climate change. Although it is one of the least developed countries and has high needs in terms of development and adaptation, Togo nonetheless wants to contribute to international efforts to limit the temperature rise to 2°C by implementing mitigation measures. Togo’s commitment is fair, equitable and ambitious, while still taking the nation’s reality into account. Over and above its national commitments, responding to current and future adaptation needs and embarking on a carbon-lean development path will require transparent, long term international cooperation and financial support.", 
"Togo is aware of the need to increase its means of action and so is committed to promoting a regional development vision for the concerned populations, in a spirit of solidarity, while also participating in the international fight against climate change.", "The INDC was prepared under the aegis of the Ministry of the Environment and Forest Resources (MERF), in a participatory, inclusive process that included the effective involvement of every stakeholder.", " 1. NATIONAL CONTEXT ", 
"1.1 Physical context ", "A West African country, Togo is located between 6° and 11° North latitude and between 0° and 1°40 East longitude, with a total area of 56,600 km². Average rainfall varies between 800 and 1,400 mm, with an average temperature of 27°C to 28°C. The country has 50 km of maritime coastline subject to erosion. Its arable land is estimated at close to 3.4 million hectares (64% of the country), just 55% of which were cultivated in 2010. Total irrigable land covers approximately 86,000 hectares, and the country’s exploitable shallows span 175,000 hectares. Surface and groundwater are estimated at between 17 and 21 billion cubic metres of water each year, for annual consumption of some 3.4 billion m3. Plant formations have been significantly degraded and the rate of deforestation stands at around 15,000 ha/year, compared with a pace of reforestation that barely exceeds 3,000 ha annually.", 
"1.2 Socioeconomic context ", "Togo’s 2010 population was 6,191,155 (4th Census, 2010), with an average annual growth rate of 2.84%. On that basis, the country can expect to reach 7,121,673 inhabitants in 2015, 60% of whom under the age of 25. As a result, Togo will need to meet the challenge of providing decent jobs to that population, once it hits the labour market. Gross domestic product (GDP) rose from FCFA 1,581.3 billion in 2010 (baseline year) to FCFA 2,076.6 billion in 2015, or a per capita GDP of FCFA 255,419 and FCFA 291,583 respectively. Despite the progress made (0.459 in 2012 (2013 HDI Report), or a 0.007 improvement over 2010), Togo’s Human Development Index (HDI) remains low (ranked 159th out of the 187 countries evaluated). Poverty is still very high in Togo, affecting 58.7% of the population in 2011 (SCAPE, August 2013), compared with 61.7% in 2006. The household lighting penetration rate stands at 23%, according to the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP, July 2015). The 2011 QUIBB well-being indicator questionnaire showed that the main social indicators had generally improved, although their levels are still worrying: net primary schooling rate (87.8%), adult literacy rate (60.3%, with a clear disparity between the sexes: 74.0% for men and 47.9% for women), morbidity rate (20.6%), rate of access to drinking water (56.1%), proportion of households with sanitation (53.1%), rate of malnutrition (27.9%), rate of households having difficulty meeting their dietary needs (49.5%), rate of use of health services (66.2%) and unemployment rate (24.3%).", 
"1.3 National and sectoral strategic development orientations ", "The national strategic orientations underlying sectoral programmes and policies can be found in the document Togo Vision 2030, currently under production, and in the Strategy for Accelerated Growth and Employment Promotion (SCAPE) 2013-2017. Togo’s SCAPE defines a development framework for the medium term in order to fulfil its General Policy Declaration (DPG) based on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) covering the 2006-2015 period and to transform Togo into an emerging country within the next 15 to 20 years. The sectoral policies and strategies in effect for vulnerable economic sectors and those emitting GHGs are recorded in Annex II, Table 1.", 
"1.4 Commitment to sustainable development ", "For several years now, Togo has been engaged in a proactive strategy for sustainable development and against global warming. Its efforts focus mainly on: bad production practices in the economic sectors; lack of population control; and the high poverty rate, which is exacerbated by the negative impacts of climate change, further reinforcing the vulnerability of the production sectors and the pressure on natural resources. This political will can be seen, amongst others, in the National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP), the National Environmental Management Programme (NEMP), the National Sustainable Development Strategy (December 2011), the National Environmental Management Capacity-building Strategy (October 2008), the National Programme for Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) 2010-2050, the National Strategy for Reducing the Risk of Catastrophes in Togo (December 2009), the National Medium Term Priority Framework (NMTPF) for Togo (2010-2015), and the National Action Plan for Marine and Coastal Environmental Resources Management. Further, Togo’s membership in the Climate &amp; Clean Air Coalition (CCAC) means it could raise funds to finance its short term GHG and climate pollutant mitigation actions.", 
"1.5 Institutional and regulatory initiatives ", "The fight against climate change and the implementation of sustainable development are part of the following key institutional initiatives: (i) existence of a ministry specifically dedicated to managing environmental and natural resources policies since 1987; (ii) creation of an Environmental Directorate at the Ministry of the Environment and Forest Resources (MERF), one of whose duties is to coordinate the mechanisms defined in the conventions that Togo has signed; (iii) creation of a National Climate Change Committee; and (iv) establishment of an institutional framework to prepare for the Third National Communication (TCN). In terms of international environmental commitments, Togo is a Party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). The main national laws adopted in relation to climate change are: Law 2008-005 of 30 May 2008 enacting the framework law on the environment replacing the Environmental Code; Law 2008-009 of 19 June 2008 enacting the Forest Code; Decree 2006-058/PR of 5 July 2006 defining a list of works, activities and planning documents subject to environment impact assessments (EIAs) and its implementing orders; Law 99-003 of 18 February 1999 enacting the Hydrocarbons Code of the Republic of Togo.", 
" 2. ADAPTATION ", "2.1 National reality and vision ", "Adaptation and development are Togo’s priorities, bearing in mind that its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2010 (baseline year) represented just 0.05% of total emissions worldwide. In consideration of the vulnerability of its economic sectors and of the social and environmental consequences of the effects of climate change, Togo has defined its national priority as the development and implementation of an adaptation strategy and options that would have an impact on the mitigation scenarios, in terms of co-benefits.", 
"Togo intends to contribute to the fight against climate change by strengthening the resilience of its production systems and means by embarking on a carbon-lean development path. This vision is in line with international commitments and national strategic orientations relating to the need for fair, inclusive growth that responds to the challenges of sustainability, creates decent jobs, helps to reduce poverty, and protects natural resources. These key points are also included in the National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) for climate change, produced in December 2008 and whose objectives relate to: (i) the protection of human lives and livelihoods, resources, infrastructure and the environment; (ii) the identification of grassroots communities’ urgent, immediate needs for adaptation to the harmful impacts of climate change and variability; and (iii) the incorporation of adaptation measures and objectives into sectoral policies and national planning.", 
"2.2 Impacts of climate change ", "Climate observations1 during the period running from 1961 to 2012 reveal an unmistakable rise in temperatures, as well as a decrease in rainfall and in the number of days of rain. The linear trend in the national average for temperature data between 1961 and 2012 indicates warming by 1°C. On the other hand, according to the baseline scenarios assessed for the Third National Communication (TCN), the simulations run using SimCLIM 2013 for the pessimistic scenario of RCP8.5 reveal an overall average annual temperature increase in Togo fluctuating between 0.60°C and 0.71°C higher than current levels in 2025, and between 3.6°C and 4.5°C higher in 2100, depending on the latitude being considered. For those same periods, annual precipitation would increase throughout the country by 4 to 8 mm over its current level in 2025 and by 18 to 39 mm of rain by 2100. The associated impacts on the main sectors considered to be sensitive are:", 
"", "Energy: a spatial analysis reveals that the savannah region, which is already facing the highest poverty rate and increasingly scarce wood resources, would have the lowest capacity to respond, with consequences that would aggravate nutritional and food insecurity and increase both monetary and non-monetary poverty. At the same time, the supply of fuel wood from Lomé and the maritime region would become virtually impossible;", "Water resources: in consideration of current and forecast demographic growth rates, the water supply would be severely affected, with a drop in stocks due to global warming and heavy pollution of drinking water reserves as a result of flooding, salt water intrusion into coastal aquifers and water encroachment;", 
"Agriculture, forestry and land use: a decline in the supply of vegetables, meats and fish and in provisions sent to the cities could lead to social tensions, or even socio-political crises, a loss of income for producers, land degradation, loss of biodiversity, pest invasions of crops, livestock and fishing yields, wood shortages, and the disappearance of wetlands;", "Human settlements (buildings and cities) and health: an increase in State, local government and household spending to build new housing and socioeconomic infrastructure and to rehouse disaster victims, massive rural exodus, the spread of illnesses like malaria, diarrhoea, cardiovascular and respiratory disease, and others, will entail additional expenses, lead to famine and aggravate food insecurity;", 
"Coastal zones: erosion causing the loss of goods and physical resources and threatening the entire coastal zone, where more than 90% of the country’s industrial units are located.", "", "2.3 Togo’s needs in terms of adaptation, with co-benefits on mitigation ", "Togo is faced with major challenges in respect of adaptation, taking account of today’s climate reality and the expected effects in a more or less faraway future, as the consequences of the announced foreseeable changes. Its needs are identified below, in the form of measures: (i) reinforcing actions in favour of energy efficiency and carbon-lean technologies; (ii) promoting integrated, sustainable water resources management; (iii) strengthening the resilience of production systems and means in the agricultural sector; (iv) building the capacities of human settlements (buildings and cities) to adapt to climate change; and (v) protecting the coastal zone.", 
"The approach selected by Togo involves the implementation of a portfolio of measures and projects in response to adaptation issues and national development priorities, bearing in mind that adaptation options that also mitigate GHG emissions will be prioritized wherever possible.", "These needs are a response to national concerns expressed by all the actors. They have been quantified and approved through a consultation process and, over and above the national process instituted as part of the launch and steering of the INDC, the different actors involved also met in thematic groups on the most vulnerable sectors. This entailed a prioritization of the sectors and subsectors and the identification of the main priority measures, as well as the conditions of their implementation. For each sector, the approach was to consider the degree of impact on national development priorities such as employment, poverty reduction, increased beneficiary revenue and GDP, and the positive impact on clean, carbon-lean growth and development, while taking the climate realities of today and tomorrow into consideration. Each sectoral measure was then broken down into a series of operational activities supplemented by an economic analysis to assess the need for financial support.", 
"An analysis of the collected data made it possible to identify the priorities, measures and funding needs (Annex IV, Table 2). The priority sectors are, by order of importance: 1st: Energy; 2nd: Agriculture; 3rd: Human settlements and health; 4th: Water resources; 5th: Coastal erosion; and 6th: Land use, land-use change and forestry.", "The total funding required is estimated at approximately US$1.54 billion between 2020 and 2030.", 
" 3. GHG EMISSIONS MITIGATION IN TOGO ", "3.1. Contributions ", "Togo plans to adopt an approach based on contributions founded on both measures to be introduced and targeted results in order to better identify any opportunities for co-benefits in terms of reducing GHG emissions that might potentially be derived from synergies between adaptation and mitigation.", "Togo’s contributions to global mitigation work can be characterized as follows:", 
"", "Commitments: Togo confirms its commitment to contributing to the achievement of the UNFCCC’s objectives to limit temperature rises to 2°C by 2030. Togo has already implemented activities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, especially in the energy, agriculture and LULUCF (land use, land-use change and forestry) sectors. Subject to being in possession of the necessary resources, Togo has confirmed that it is aiming for a more ambitious reduction target.", "Main data sources: national climate strategies, policies and actions plans; prior UNFCCC submissions; declarations at the United Nations Climate Summit; Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMA); national communications; and a new analysis performed for the purpose of producing the INDC.",

This reduction in emissions is attributed to the implementation of sectoral work.", "Targets: The conditional target for additional GHG emissions reduction, according to the most ambitious scenario, is estimated at 20% compared to the dynamic BAU. The conditional target for the total reduction would therefore be 31.14% in 2030, compared to the projections if no measures were to be applied.", 
"Stakeholder support and engagement: The process for determining the contributions was a participatory one, with a number of consultations with the stakeholders in order to understand the realities and the concerns of key sectors like energy, agriculture and LULUCF.", "", "3.2 GHG mitigation measures and options ", "Togo’s GHG mitigation measures in its three priority sectors (energy, agriculture, and land use, landuse change and forestry) and the associated costs (totalling US$1.1 billion) are described below.", 
"", "In the energy sector, they pertain to the promotion of household use of biomass, plus solar electricity and road transport. As concerns biomass, this will entail the implementation of a proactive policy (with incentives, support and training for craftsmen, appropriate distribution channels, etc.) that can promote the roll-out of energy-efficient stoves, which can yield 50-60% savings in wood and charcoal. Emphasis will also be placed on the introduction of solar equipment in households and on capacity-building for the various actors concerned. In terms of road transport, the planned actions aim to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels in Togo by 20% over the course of the period under review, by improving the road system, promoting the use of public transport, reducing the average age of imported vehicles (to 5-7 years) and promoting active modes of transport (bicycles, walking, bike paths). Cost: US$460 million.", 
"For the agricultural sector, mitigation options have been identified in the fields of livestock farming, rice growing, farmland and the burning of the savannahs. Concerning livestock, the actions will involve the introduction of fodder to improve animal digestion, support in the promotion of local breeds, and extensive livestock farming. In terms of the rice industry, the actions will target the identification and promotion of varieties of rain-fed rice, and support and guidance in the better use of organic matter (for faster decomposition) in the paddy fields. For farmland, a study will be conducted to characterize it into agro-ecological zones, as well as a research and support programme on organic and synthetic enriching agents that release less GHG, the study and promotion of optimal waste management for livestock and harvest remnants, and the promotion of land use planning practices that boost carbon’s binding to farmland and agroforestry. In respect of the burning of the savannahs, the planned actions target a participatory fight against bush fires. Cost: US$140 million.", 
"In the land use, land-use change and forestry sector, the priority actions relate to: (i) the promotion of private, community and State reforestation through the creation of plantations and the promotion of agroforestry on cultivated land; (ii) sustainable forest planning and protection (by managing brush fires, regenerating degraded sites, and demarcating and developing protected areas and tourist sites); and (iii) the cartographic study of geographic areas with a strong potential for the development of biofuels in conjunction with food security issues.

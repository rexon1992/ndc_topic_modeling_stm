Furthermore, IPCC scenarios (SRES A1B scenario as shown in the IPCC 4th Assessment Report) have projected an increase of mean annual temperature in the region by 1.2 to 3.2°C by the 2060s, and 1.7 to 5.1°C by the 2090s. Climate models predict that over the next 50 to 100 years, Angola will experience increased temperatures, more extreme weather events, an expansion of arid and semi-arid regions, seasonal shifts in rainfall, localized floods, increased wildfires, sea level rise, increased rainfall in the northern parts of the country, changes in river flows and changes in sea and lake temperatures. According to the Angolan NAPA (2011), the major expected climate change threats and impacts are: floods, soil erosion, drought episodes, rise in sea-level. The main sectors identified as affected by climate change are: agriculture and food security; forest and biodiversity; fisheries; water resources; human health; infrastructures; coastal zones; energy.",

In addition, the production of renewable energy and the dispatching of the entire production to the Angolan electrical system will not only reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) but also will mitigate local pollution caused by atmospheric emissions from burning fossil fuel.

FAIRNESS AND AMBITION", "Angola is extremely vulnerable to the impacts of Climate Change and some specific regions of Angola such as the southern regions are already experiencing a regular worsening of droughts and floods, as well as costal degradation and regional and national-level adaptation action plans are in place to address those sectors which have been particularly affected. The estimated global warming of 2°C would imply for Angola severe economic losses for Agriculture sector, a sector that contributes to over 8% of the country GDP and at threat to the stability of food security. The Government of Angola has been diverting own funds to carry out implementation of complementary initiatives addressing these Climate Change impacts.", 
"In addition, Angola is the third-largest economy in Sub-Saharan Africa and a net exporter of fossil fuels, and by now the second largest oil producer in sub-Saharan Africa after Nigeria. According to the country‟s Initial National Communication (INC) report to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) released in 2012 (but based on emission inventory statistics from 2005) Angola only contributed approximately with 66.8 million tons of CO2e of Greenhouse Gas Emissions to the atmosphere. This contribution is meagre and represents a small percentage of current global GHG emissions. However, though showing an insignificant contribution, at 0.1% of the total global emissions, while the per-capita emissions are 4.15 tons of CO2e in 2005[5] compared to the global average[6].Angola recognises that in order to meet the 2 degree objective all countries will need to undertake mitigation measures. In fact the Government of Angola has enacted a considerable amount of Laws and Policies as well has developed important sectoral studies which gives an idea of how determined the Government Authorities are to take the country to the forefront of African countries reducing their GHG emissions.Angola‟s approach focuses on avoiding an increase of emissions per capita beyond the current level, while pursuing its development goals.Through this INDC Angola is determined to reduce its emissions trajectory by nearly 50% below the BAU scenario by 2030. In selecting the actions outlined above, Angola has prioritised those which fit with the growth priorities set out in its national development plans in particular the Angola 2025 Policy Document. In addition, Angola has captured the synergies between mitigation and adaptation, not only by prioritising those adaptation activities with significant mitigation co-benefits but also by seeking to minimise the carbon footprint of its adaptation portfolio as a whole. Angola is therefore putting forward Mitigation actions as well as Adaptation measures with mitigation benefits amounting over 15,7 billion USDthat align with a low carbon development pathway, which to be fully implemented would require additional international support in the form of finance, technology transfer and capacity building.", 
"5. MEANS OF IMPLEMENTATION", "Angola‟s contribution will be implemented following the Government strategy set of pursuing the enforcement/execution of the already enacted laws and policiesso to reduce the gap between the recent vigorous legislative activity and the real implementation of mitigation measures. Within this framework Angola has already engaged with Clean Development Mechanism by submitting a number of important large scale projects. This action will be complemented by the continuation of climate change mitigation/adaptation mainstreaming into the National Plans and Policies as well as the implementation of the National Strategy for the Implementation of UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol. This framework comprises: generating reports and inventories about GHG emissions in Angola and their impact on the environment and public health; producing programmes and projects with measures to mitigate climate change; developing technical and professional training actions in areas related to climate change; fostering international co-operation within the context of climate change, particularly in terms of transfer of knowledge, experience and technology. Therefore,Angola will address the clear shortness of human and technical capacity to keep abreast with the real situation of GHG emissions in the various sectors for which Angola will require support to implement capacity building and training at various level and sectors.", 
"The overall preliminary cost of implementing the proposed Mitigation and Adaptation contributions amount to over 15.7 billion USD across sectors up to 2030. Some of this amount has already been provided by the Government of Angola within the Unconditional Mitigation and Adaptation scenario. Therefore, the implementation of all the Conditional mitigation and adaptation contributions that the country endeavour to deliver will require international support in form of finance, investment, technology development and transfer, and capacity-building to fully accomplish the intended contributions.", 
"6. SOCIO-ECONOMIC BENEFITS", "The accomplishment of the mitigation and adaptation contributions being proposed in the Angolan INDC will undoubtedly bring important benefit for the wider communities and to the rural communities in particular, namely:", "", "The climate resilience program includes increasing hydropower plants and other renewable energy sources to provide electricity to rural communities and businesses, replacing diesel fuelled off grid generation.", 
"The implementation of the proposed contribution carries a huge potential of youth job creation in the country either through the local manufacturing/assembly of renewable energy machines/parts or through the forestation and afforestation programmes which demand for labour will be certainly a source of employment for the rural communities.", "The eventual support provided by the international community to Angola will strengthen the technical capacity of the country‟s human resources through assisted training and capacity building programmes.", 
"Finally, overall, both the mitigation and the adaptation actions offered as contribution in the Angolan INDC will certainly enhance the adaptive capacity of the rural population and consequently augmenting their resilience to climate change impacts.", "", "7. GENDER PERSPECTIVE", "The underlining policies supporting the implementation of the INDC mitigation and adaptation contributions and the actions to be implemented in this context include cross-cutting issues which are gender sensitive and therefore will take into account women as important decision makers regarding energy consumption in particular. Systematically, mitigation and adaptation measures offered in the Angolan INDC emphasize the importance of their implementation avoiding exacerbation of the impacts of climate change that already have disproportionate adverse effects based solely on gender, in particular in the agriculture, water resources and biomass energy sectors.",

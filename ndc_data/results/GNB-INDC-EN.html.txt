"Independent Developing State (SIDS), Guinea-Bissau has the great honor to communicate its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC), as well as all pertinent information aiming at clarity, transparency and understanding of its contributions.", "This INDC is inspired on the second generation of the National Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRSP II) aligned with the National Strategic Plan – TERRA RANKA 2015-2025. All they have mainstreamed the priorities of the National Action Plan for Climate Change Adaptation (NAPA, 2006).", 
"NATIONAL CONTEXT", "Guinea-Bissau is located in the West African north-western Inter-tropical zone, 10º59 '- 12º20' north latitude and 13º40 '- 16º43' west longitude, with an area of 36,125 km2. Poverty eradication is one of the key objectives of the Guinea-Bissau Government. The country’s population is estimated at 1,548,159 inhabitants (2014) with a growth rate of 2.2% in 1991-2009. According to the results of the Light Survey on Poverty Assessment (ILAP II, 2010) 69.3% of Guineans are poor and 33% are extremely poor. Guinea-Bissau is an integral part of the LDC group. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita is estimated at USD 750 (2014) with a real growth rate of GDP of 2.9%. According to the United Nations Development Programme Report / Unit of Policy and Strategy (2014) the country was ranked 177 in the world ranking and had a Human Development Index (HDI) of 0.396. It is a country with considerable natural capital. It has significant water resources, translated into 130 km3/ year of surface water and 445 km3/year of groundwater, a vast and rich maritime territory (54,000 km2 in 270 km of coastline), considerable biodiversity within West Africa. Nearly 10% of its territory is covered by mangrove, perhaps the most significant proportion of the world. Currently about 15% of the country’s land and maritime territory is a sanctuary for the preservation of biodiversity and this percentage is expected to increase to 26% in 2020.", 
"Guinea-Bissau is also considered a SIDS country, part of the AIMS region of SIDS (Africa, Indian and South China Sea), due to its island characteristics, with an archipelago consisting of over 88 islands and islets.", "Guinea-Bissau environment is an exceptional ecosystem and one of the weakest in the world. The main environmental challenges revolve around deforestation/soil erosion and the coastal area, biodiversity conservation and quality of water resources. Forest fires destroy more than 120 hectares of forest per year. On the other hand Guinea-Bissau is an absolute Green House Gas (GHG) sink country, i.e., it is contributing to global climate change mitigation whilst being one of the most affected countries by climate change consequences. This determines the focus of the country on climate change.", 
"Adaptation and risk reduction are priorities. Nevertheless, the country has identified additional mitigation actions that may constitute contributions (INDC). The implementation of these measures, both for adaptation and mitigation purposes requires financial resources, access to technology and capacity building, to be provided by external partners.", "The Guinean state has the organization and legal framework to meet challenges regarding environmental issues: Law 1/2011 of 2 March approved the Basic Environment Law.",

"In the same way as with mitigation, the cost benefit analysis on adaptation at national level has not yet been made. It is expected that with an increase in the area of protected areas from 15% to 26% the capacity of adaptation of national ecosystems through the protection of soil reinforcement against erosion from water and wind order will increase, and the coast’s protection against the rising sea level and other types of erosion.", "The reasons behind the inclusion of the adaptation component in any given national contribution were based on the fact that the country is a sink of greenhouse gases and is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change (AR4/IPCCC, Africa’s Adaptation Gap Report, 2013, and Germanwatch, 2013) and requires external support to have a resilient development bearing in mind that it is a LDC. Thus, INDCs are seen as a mechanism to raise the national adaptation programme to at an international level in order to attract technical, financial and capacity building support for implementation.",

Summary of trends of climate change impacts and vulnerabilities.", "The National Programme of Action for Adaptation to Climate Change of Guinea-Bissau found that gradual increases in temperature and reductions in rainfall will significantly reduce agricultural productivity and exacerbate water shortages. It is therefore necessary and urgent that the Guinea-Bissau Government take initiatives such as the development of new, more resistant , crops and changes in agricultural systems in order to increase the resilience of its agriculture to climate change, the protection of coastal ecosystems and adopt measures to reduce long term risks, like the integration of climate change into local development plans, forest management plans and soil occupancy and, generally speaking, in development policies and strategies.",

Deforestation is responsible for emitting large amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere. The estimates show a decline of around 625,000 m3 of wood per year.", 
"Therefore, the main mitigation measure to be adopted by the country, which may be a national contribution, is related to reforestation. The second sector that contributes more to GHG emissions is the energy sector. Despite the fact that global average electrification rate of the country is about 12%, Guinea-Bissau was, is and remains one of the countries facing the greatest need of access to modern forms of energy in Africa and the world.

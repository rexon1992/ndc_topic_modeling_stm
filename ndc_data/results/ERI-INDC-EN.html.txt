Moreover, as follow up to the Warsaw proposal followed by the Lima call for climate action, Eritrea has prepared its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) for the period 20202030with the view that global determination to tackle the effects of climate change calls for commitment from all parties with regard to mitigation, adaptation and implementation.", 
"In developing its INDC, Eritrea undertook a broad stakeholders representation and consultation processes. This process allowed for the baseline assessment, and review of policies and programs that are being implemented by the Government of the State of Eritrea to combat global warming and for the level of ambition to which the country wants to commit in its INDC.", "In the mitigation, the main gases covered are CO2, CH4 and N2O. Key sectors that contribute to the greenhouse gases emission are: Energy, Transport, Industry, Waste, Forestry and Agriculture. Vulnerable sectors to impacts of climate change that need adaption measures include Agriculture, Marine resources, Health, water and land resources.", 
"In 2010, the total greenhouse gases emission estimated using the GACMO model amounts to ktCO2 3972, whereas, the business as usual scenario of GHGs emission in the year 2030 isexpected to be ktCO2 6331. ", "The country focussing on the energy sector assumes two scenarios, in the mitigation of the greenhouse gases emission plans for the next 15 years: reducing by 39.2% unconditionally and 80.6 % in the conditional scenario assuming external assistance compared to the business as usual scenarios.", 
"The INDCs also presents concrete measures and steps that need to be taken in the implementation the projects and programs. These include, capacity building, technology transfer, financial support and partnership with regional and international agencies involved in climate change.", "To ensure effective implementation of the INDC program, M &amp; E tools are proposed. This includes periodic monitoring of the activities stipulated in the project documents so as to verify the right direction towards the intended outcome in mitigation and adaption.", 
"1. National Context ", "1.1 Rationale and Process for Developing INDCs ", "Eritrea is located in the Horn of Africa, lying between 12&deg;22′, and 18&deg;02′north and between 36&deg;26′ and 43&deg;13′east. Sudan borders it in the west, Ethiopia in the south, Djibouti in the south east, and the Red Sea in the east. The country has a total land area of 124,300 km2, and a coast line of 1900km. Eritrea’s territorial waters in the Red Sea zone is about 120,000 km2.", 
"It has diversified Eco geographic zones that provide unique habitat for the marine terrestrial fauna and flora. In 2010, the population of Eritrea was estimated to be 3.2 million with an annual population growth rate of 2.9%, comprising of 65% living in the rural areas. The economic activity, for most of the population, mainly relies on rain fed agriculture and artisanal fisheries.", "Climatically 70% of the country is hot to very hot with annual mean temperatures of 27&deg;C; 20% is mild with temperature of 19&deg;C and the remaining 10% is cool with mean temperature of less than 19&deg;C. Eritrea is vulnerable to climate change and boththe marine and terrestrial ecosystems have been negatively affected.Over the past 60 years temperature has risen by approximately 1.7&deg;C with tremendous impact on biodiversity losses, sea level rise and coral bleaching due to increase in sea water temperature, decline in food production, loss of biodiversity and overall loss of resilience of the ecosystem. Hence, the country plans to adapt climate smart technologies to counteract the adverse impacts of climate change, so as to improve the health and social wellbeing of the population.", 
"Against the above background, the purpose of the preparation of the INDCs is to promote environmentally sound, socially acceptable and climate resilient economic development by following lowcarbon development path and increasing adapting capacity to the adverse impacts of climate change.", "Under paragraph 14 of the Lima Call for Climate Action, countries were invited to describe how their intended nationally determined contribution “contributes to the achievement of the objective of the Convention” (UNFCCC 2014). The latest climate science shows what needs to be happening globally in order to have a probably chance of limiting warming to 2&deg;C, the goal adopted by the UNFCCC. Global emissions must peak by 2020, and net GHG emissions must be phased out over the Long term. This will require all major emitting regions to make substantial reductions below their projected baseline business-as-usual emissions over the course of this century. Cumulative global emissions must remain within the carbon budget, which is the maximum amount of cumulative carbon the world can emit to have a probably chance of limiting warming to 2&deg;C.", 
"1.2 Summary of climate change trends, impacts and vulnerabilities ", "The rainfall regime varies in space and time. It ranges from 50mm along the coastal area to 1000 mm in smaller area along the eastern escarpment; 50% of the country receive less than 300mm; 40% 300600mm, and 10% greater than 600mm. Hence, by virtue of its geographical location, Eritrea is prone to climatic variability i.e. recurrent droughts, (decrease in amount of rainfall from 550 to 400mm in the highlands), changes in seasonality that had resulted frequent crop failure, massive death of livestock, genetic erosion, extinction of endemic species, degradation of habitats and disequilibria in the ecosystem structure and function.", 
"The impact of climate change is manifested in recurrent droughts, desertification, sea level rise and increase in sea water temperature, depletion of ground water, widespread land degradation, and emergence of climate sensitive diseases. The combined net effect has resulted in food insecurity. ", "Eritrea is committed to gender equity and social justice. 30% of the National Assembly is composed of women.", "Increased climate variability has already been evidenced in Eritrea. Eritrea has experienced frequent and recurrent droughts since the early 1920s which has aggravated food insecurity and poverty. The spread of malaria in the highlands, which has never been experienced before, desertification and decline in biodiversity have also been witnessed. A number of recent assessments have revealed that observed climate change already has serious impacts on socioeconomic systems and livelihoods of the country.", 
"1.3 Existing Policies and Legal Framework Related to Climate Change ", "As Shown in Table 1 Eritrea has already developed various macro and micro polices and legal instruments, plans, guidelines and communication documents which have important contribution to the adaptation and mitigation of climate change.

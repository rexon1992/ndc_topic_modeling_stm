Background ", "The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPR Korea) has always paid a great attention to the environment protection work in constructing the socialist power.", 
"The respected Comrade Kim Jong Un said:", "“Environmental protection work should be improved so as to protect and increase the country’s resources and keep its air, rivers and seas completely free from pollution”", "Under the wise guidance of the respected Comrade Kim Jong Un, chairman of the State Affairs Commission of DPR Korea, the Republic recently has made much progress in conducting the forest restoration campaign, thus has achieved a great success in establishing the sufficient material and technical foundation for environment protection, afforestation and enclosing-with-park throughout the country. Besides, large or medium and small hydro power stations including the Paektusan Hero Youth Power Station were constructed and much progress has been made in improving the efficiency of electricity generation and consumption, as well as in scaling up the utilization of the renewable energy. All these efforts resulted in the advances towards the protection of air pollution and climate change.", 
"Many scientific and technological advances including the cycling production system in agricultural sector and zero-energy, zero-carbon architecture in construction sector have been achieved so as to accelerate the sustainable development of social and economic sectors.", "In addition, DPR Korea has established the legal and policy framework to respond the climate change by supplementing the Law on Environment Protection with the contents related to climate change and newly enacting the Law on Environment Impact Assessment.", 
"Especially, in order to contribute to international efforts to address climate change issues, DPR Korea ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on 5 December 1994, the Kyoto Protocol on 27 April 2005 and the Paris Agreement on 1 August 2016.", "As a non-Annex I Party, DPR Korea prepared the First National Communication and Second National Communication in cooperation with the UNEP and under the coordination of the National Coordinating Committee for Environment, and submitted them to the UNFCCC secretariat respectively in September 2002 and February 2013.", 
"DPR Korea is now making progress towards initiating the enabling activities to prepare the Third National Communication and the First Biennial Update Report under international support.", "In 1999, the least-cost GHG abatement strategy was developed under the support of the UNDP/GEF.", "Integrating climate change considerations into relevant socio-economic development strategies and plans is considered as one of the important measures to ensure the sustainable development in DPR Korea. Especially in accordance with five-year strategy for national economic development, national energy and climate change issues are simultaneously to be addressed by improving the efficiency of electric power generating facilities and by scaling up the utilization of renewable energy.", 
"Pursuant to decisions 1/CP.19, 1/CP.20 and 1/CP.21 of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC, the Government of the DPR Korea is pleased to prepare its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC). DPR Korea’s INDC includes a mitigation and an adaptation component.", "The mitigation component includes both unconditional and conditional contributions. The unconditional contributions are measures that will be implemented using domestic resources. With domestic resources, GHG emissions will be reduced by 8.0% by 2030 compared to the Business as Usual scenario (BAU). The conditional contributions are measures that could be implemented if additional international financial support, technology transfer and capacity building are received. The national contribution could be increased up to 40.25% with international support.", 
"The adaptation component describes the adaptation needs raised in terms of institutional arrangement, financing, capacity building and technology transfer by 2030. It also presents the prioritized adaptation measures.", "When considering the development priorities and adaptation needs in DPR Korea as one of developing countries, international support for developing countries under the Paris Agreement is required to encourage DPR Korea to scale up his mitigation measures to the level contributable to addressing climate change, an international issue on a global scale.",

With the GHG emission of 2.9tCO2e per capita in 2000, DPR Korea is one of low GHG emitting countries in terms of emissions per capita. GHG emission per capita will be increased to 6.5tCO2e in 2030, but it will be still below the world average.", 
"Considering the significance of energy issues in ensuring the sustainable development, DPR Korea continue to give national development priority on the work to keep energy production ahead of economic development. But there are no domestic oil and natural gas resources in DPR Korea. Thus domestic coal accounts now for a comparatively large share of energy consumption in energy and industrial sector. This share has a tendency to increase with the activation of the national economy in the near future.", 
"In order to make national contribution to mitigation of climate change fair and ambitious in this development context, DPR Korea attaches the mitigation priorities to the energy and industrial sector in where it is possible to pursue synergy with adaptation to climate change, and thus expects to decrease GHG emission per final energy use and GDP.", "DPR Korea’s GDP per capita is 462US$ in 2000. This implies that capability of DPR Korea for mitigation measures with only domestic resource is not sufficient to contribute to responding the climate change, an issue on a global scale.",

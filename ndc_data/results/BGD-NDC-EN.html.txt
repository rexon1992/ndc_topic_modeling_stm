"Bangladesh is a highly climate vulnerable country whose emissions are less than 0.35% of global emissions[1]. Without ambitious action to limit greenhouse gases internationally, the future costs of adapting to climate change will be much higher than they are today. If the world fails to take ambitious action, the costs to Bangladesh of climate change could amount to an annual loss of 2% of GDP by 2050 and 9.4% of GDP by 2100[2]. Bangladesh therefore wants to play its part in the global collective action to reduce future emissions as part of a robust and ambitious international agreement.", 
"Consequently, Bangladesh is adopting a two-fold strategy against climate change. The main focus of Bangladesh’s activities is on increasing our resilience to the impacts of climate change - which are already affecting the livelihoods of much of our population and will continue to do so in the future. For example, extreme temperatures, erratic rainfall, floods, drought, tropical cyclones, rising sea levels, tidal surges, salinity intrusion and ocean acidification are causing serious negative impacts on the lives and livelihoods of millions of people in Bangladesh, and are gradually offsetting the remarkable socio-economic development gained over the past 30 years, as well as jeopardising future economic growth. However at the same time, Bangladesh is also working to achieve lower- carbon as well as more resilient development. With this in mind, this INDC aims to put forth mitigation actions that Bangladesh can take to tackle its growing emissions and to play its role in global efforts to limit temperature rise to two degrees or preferably 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels.", 
"With respect to Bangladesh’s contribution to global efforts to counter climate change, this INDC sets out a number of mitigation actions that will help limit the country’s GHG emissions. These mitigation actions will play a key role in realising the move to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy and to becoming a middle-income country by 2021 whilst ensuring that it will not cross the average per capita emissions of the developing world. The INDC includes both unconditional and conditional emissions reduction goals for the power, transport, and industry sectors, alongside further mitigation actions in other sectors, which Bangladesh intends to carry out. Bangladesh intends to implement its conditional emissions reduction goal subject to appropriate international support in the form of finance, investment, technology development and transfer, and capacity building. The foundation of this INDC is Bangladesh’s existing strategies and plans, in particular the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP), Renewable Energy Policy 2008, the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Master Plan (E&amp;CC Master Plan), the forthcoming National Adaptation Plan, the National Sustainable Development Strategy, the Perspective Plan (Vision 2021) and the Sixth (and forthcoming seventh) Five Year Plan, the National Disaster Management Plan and the Disaster Management Act.

GHG projections were developed to be consistent with Bangladesh’s aim of becoming a middle-income country by 2021. The exact approach to estimating GHG emissions was tailored for each sector according to the availability of data. For example, GHG emissions from road transport were calculated in a relatively disaggregated manner, by combining data on numbers of vehicles, distances travelled and the fuel efficiencies of the vehicles. Similarly, GHG emissions from electricity use in households were calculated in a detailed bottom-up manner, using data on projected numbers of electrical appliances and their efficiencies. On the other hand, GHG emissions from industry were calculated using aggregated energy demand data per industrial sub-sector and forecasts of future industrial output. Future emissions were modelled using the LEAP model, with emissions being calculated from the relevant activity data and emissions factors.",

Fair and ambitious goal", "Bangladesh is a Least Developed Country (LDC) whose emissions are less than 0.35% of global emissions. However, Bangladesh recognises that in order to meet the 2 degrees objective all countries will need to undertake mitigation in line with the IPCC conclusion that meeting 2 degrees requires global reductions to reduce by 40 to 70% global anthropogenic GHG emissions reductions by 2050 compared to 2010. Bangladesh’s approach is driven by the long-term goal announced by its Prime Minister that its per capita GHG emissions will not exceed the average for developing countries. Therefore, Bangladesh’s approach focuses on putting itself on a pathway which will avoid an increase of emissions per capita beyond this level, while pursuing national development goals.", 
"Despite its current status as a LDC and its currently small share of past and current global GHGs, Bangladesh is still putting forward actions which will allow the country to embark on a low carbon development pathway, keeping in mind the global climate change agenda. This INDC represents the first time that Bangladesh has made an international undertaking to take action on mitigation and therefore fulfils the requirements of the Lima Call for Climate Action to go beyond existing efforts. The actions needed to deliver on these commitments will require international support in the form of finance, technology transfer and capacity building. Bangladesh will also provide a relevant contribution with regards to national financial resources, staff time and strong integration of development and mitigation activities.", 
"In selecting the actions set out above, Bangladesh has prioritised those which fit with the growth priorities set out in our national development plans. In addition, Bangladesh has captured the synergies between mitigation and adaptation, not only by prioritising those adaptation activities with significant mitigation co-benefits, but also by seeking to minimise the carbon footprint of adaptation portfolio as a whole. The INDC contains a mix of measures that have already been taken forward under its own resources, thus demonstrating that Bangladesh is not content to wait for international support to take action on climate change.",

Adaptation", "3.1 Country situation on vulnerability", "Bangladesh, one of the world’s most disaster-prone climate vulnerable countries, has faced dozens of major disasters over its short history as a nation. Located on the Bay of Bengal, Bangladesh is particularly susceptible to seasonal cyclones, acting as a funnel for heavy precipitation from the Indian Ocean and creating extreme weather events. The country sits on the flood plain of several major rivers, which drain from the mountainous regions of the Himalayas, making seasonal flooding another hazard often coinciding with the cyclone season. Current research and studies suggest that flood, tropical cyclones, storm surge and drought are likely to be more frequent and severe in the years to come. The Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI-2011) calculated the vulnerability of 170 countries to the impacts of climate change over the next 30 years[3], which reveals that Bangladesh is the most vulnerable country to climate change.", 
"Climate change adaptation is a key priority and the country has already undertaken initiatives to mainstream adaptation into national development such as in the water, health, forestry, agriculture and more prominently in the infrastructure sectors. Bangladesh is already experiencing a host of climate impacts, including floods, storm surges, drought and river bank erosion. For example, floods in 2007 inundated 32,000 sq. km, leading to over 85,000 houses being destroyed and almost 1 million damaged, with approximately 1.2 million acres of crops destroyed or partially damaged, 649 deaths and estimated damage over $1 billion. Climate change will drastically hamper economic growth of the country. For instance, the Asian Development Bank estimated that Bangladesh may experience a 2% GDP annual loss by 2050 because of climate change.",

"To enhance climate change adaptation activities in all key policies and sectors, Bangladesh has recently established two innovative funds: the Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund (BCCTF) from the Government’s own budget and the Bangladesh Climate Change Resilient Fund (BCCRF) with the support of development partners.

About 195,000 hectares of mangrove plantations have been raised so far and these new plantations are also playing an important role in carbon sequestration. More analysis needs to be carried out on future GHG emissions and mitigation options for the LULUCF sector and when this is done, further consideration will be given to mitigation-adaptation synergies in this sector.",

"Responsibility is reflected in a country’s past, current and future greenhouse gas emissions. Total emissions, as well as per capita emissions, are to be considered. The Republic of Moldova’s responsibility in terms of greenhouse gas emissions is low. In 2013, the Republic of Moldova emitted 12.8 Mt CO2 eq (without LULUCF) and 12.7 Mt CO2 eq (with LULUCF), which is less than 0.03 per cent of current world’s emissions.Total and net per capita emissions were less than half of the world’s average (3.2 tCO2 eq/capita vs 6.4 tCO2 eq/capita (reference), respectively 3.1 tCO2 eq/capita vs 6.8 tCO2 eq/capita respectively)1.

"The capacity to contribute to solving the climate change problem is closely related to the ability to invest in appropriate mitigation measures. Hence, one aspect of capacity is to take into account the GDP growth level and GDP per capita in fairness considerations. In this context, it is worth mentioning that within 1990-2014 period, the Real GDP decreased in the Republic of Moldova by 29 per cent, from 9.8935 to 6.9881 billion 2010 US$, while the real GDP per capita decreased by 14 per cent, from 2,261.9 to 1,950.2 2010 US$2.", 
"The mitigation potential and abatement costs are other core aspects in considering a fair contribution of a country. The greenhouse gas intensity (“CO2 emissions per GDP”) indices decreased considerably within 1990-2013 period in the Republic of Moldova, from 4.4 to 1.9 kg CO2 per real GDP 2010 US$ (without LULUCF), or by 56.4 per cent; and, from 3.8 to 1.9 kg CO2 per real GDP 2010 US$ (with LULUCF), or by 56.8 per cent respectively.", "These values are still among the highest within the transition economies from the Central and Eastern Europe and reveal a high mitigation potential to achieve the Republic of Moldova's reduction targets. But, in order to reach the conditional target of up to 78 per cent reduction of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, appropriate international financial support approximately equal to US$ 4.9-5.1 billion, i.e. about US$ 327-340 million per year until 2030, is needed; the support needed will be in addition to the domestic allocations to cover the required abatement costs.", 
"This support will allow adjusting the development pathway of the Republic of Moldova towards a low-carbon economy, thus moving towards progressive decoupling of carbon emissions from economic growth and ensuring a decent level of Real GDP per capita, equal to 4,483 US$/capita in 2030, which will still be approximately one-tenth of EU 28 average, forecasted to be US$ 43,516/capita3 in 2030.", "As stated above, along with the international financial support for covering the abatement costs, the country will also need assistance in form of technology transfer and capacity building.",

To support climate change adaptation initiatives, both domestic financial resources as well as international ones are required. Domestic financing can be secured both from the state budget and from other financial mechanisms (special funds: National Ecological Fund, National Fund for Regional Development, etc.). They will be important tools for directing the domestic monetary flows in environmental investments, and a means of strengthening the external and domestic financing). Foreign assistance and investments is envisaged to play the most important role in promoting climate change actions in all economic sectors and in catalysing the specific investments that will be needed to assure climate change adaptation in the Republic of Moldova. These investments are linked to a wide range of technologies intended to improve the energy efficiency, use of renewable energy, develop the related road and building infrastructure, and finally adapt to climate change. In this context, the international financial support is needed to implement in full extent the appropriate national and sectorial policies and strategies, or to resolve specific issues in the fields where the climate change impact is significant. Implementation of small and mediumscale pilot and demonstration projects will involve sustainability of external assistance to be received, including through financial mechanisms available under the UNFCCC.",

Based on this report, the next stage of strategic planning of climate change adaptation has to be decided.", 
"Further, the Republic of Moldova will put in place a four year based NAPs and SAPs. The proposed framework for NAPs and SAPs will allow for monitoring and planning along a 3-tier M&amp;E approach.", "First tier, macro-level monitoring would allow for tracking the evolution of the national adaptation planning process as a whole.", "This would entail the development of a number of process-oriented indicators that would be followed across sectors. Examples of such indicators could include: number of SAPs; overall level of Government funding channelled towards adaptation needs; index of resilience/vulnerability of the Moldovan economy, etc. These indicators would provide an image of the overall dynamism of the adaptation planning process as a whole. As such, they may depend on the aggregation of data from lower-level indicators (e.g., data on adaptation funding by sector). The final indicator on level of resilience would allow for tracking of the impact of the adaptation process as a whole. It would have to be computed from recognized vulnerability indices and legitimate sources of data. The next NAP will be used to develop the ‘Index’, ‘Methodology’ and to gather ‘Baseline Data’.", 
"Second tier, meso-level monitoring would allow for tracking of progress and results at a disaggregated level, either sectoral or geographic (e.g., regional), depending on the choices made during planning phases.", "These indicators would depend on the provision of data from regional or sectoral authorities. Such indicators would be the following: the number and type of adaptation measures included in sectoral/regional plans, proportion of sectoral budget dedicated to adaptation measures, number/type of sectoral stakeholders implementing adaptation or resilient measures, degree to which the sector/region’s vulnerability has been reduced.", 
"Similarly to the first tier, the final indicator would be an ‘Index’ for which the ‘Methodology’ would be determined in the early phases of NAP planning. Also, while these indicators remain somewhat process-oriented, it could be possible to adopt more concrete indicators within each sector (e.g., if water availability was a constraint to resilience, the water sector M&amp;E framework could adopt an indicator on “overall water availability”).", "Sector-specific indicators would have to be agreed upon during the early phases of NAPs or SAPs planning, and could be renewed, depending on their relevance, at the end of each planning period. However, it would be important to keep a number of indicators similar from one sector to the next, to enable comparisons. The prioritization of adaptation measures will be done by the sectors or stakeholders participating in the development and implementation of NAPs and SAPs.", 
"Each time a SAP or a NAP is proposed, it should contain prioritized measures for that planning period. The process of determining the prioritization and selection of certain adaptation options over others should be transparent, and based on rationalized criteria. Ideally, it would be carried out by a stakeholder group, which can consider different economic, environmental, social, cultural or political spheres and concerns. The M&amp;E system will verify if the planned measures have been implemented accordingly. The Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA), Cost Effectiveness Analysis (CEA), Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and other relevant to case econometric assessment methods and tools will be used.", 
"Third tier, a micro-level structure of reporting would also be defined. This would concern indicators related to specific adaptation actions that are adopted within individual sectoral or national plan. For each action or group of actions, a target and an indicator have to be developed (e.g., number of people trained; hectares of forest protected; kilometres of road upgraded; degree of water use (drop-per-crop) efficiency in the wine sector, etc.). Each of these indicators should be attached to the actions contained in the specific sectoral or regional action plan. As such, they would serve as the basis level of results tracking by stakeholders, and would be reported upon annually at least. They could be modified at each round of successive planning, and be aggregated to feed into the meso- and macro-level reporting frameworks. Responsibility for providing information on these indicators would rest upon those who will also be tasked with the implementation of the adaptation actions.", 
"The milestones for reporting under the national adaptation planning process would be as follows:", "", "micro-level indicators: annually;", "meso- and macro-level indicators: every two year.", "", "As each NAP will be set for four years, this would mean that results could be tracked and aggregated twice per period, allowing for an informed planning process for the next phases. Naturally, the first planning period would also entail a baseline assessment of key indicators, and some time to develop the methodologies and indices.", 
"At the end of a planning cycle, the data would be aggregated into a “NAP Impact Study”, which would synthesize all results achieved during the period and make recommendations for the next period. This study will be submitted for consideration to the Government.", "The main responsibility for reporting will be of the sectoral administrations, which would need to undertake annual and biennial reporting for micro- and meso-level indicators. All data would be provided to the coordination mechanism, whose secretariat could synthesize information to develop reports. The Secretariat would also provide sectoral administrations with templates and formats in order to allow for standardized tracking. Also, a database would be created to be administered by the coordination mechanism, being accessible however to all participating administrations, in order to facilitate the flow of information. In addition, micro-level reporting could be undertaken with the participation of local NGOs and associations which would participate in the implementation of targeted adaptation measures. Participation of NGOs at all levels of the M&amp;E framework would allow for increased transparency and for broader ownership and dissemination of results.",

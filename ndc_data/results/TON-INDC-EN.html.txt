To facilitate this high level commitment, Government has raised climate change to Ministerial level, establishment of the Legislative Assembly Standing Committee for Climate Change, developing of National Climate Change Policy, revision of the Joint National Action Plan to Integrate Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction, and development of the third Climate Change National Communication.", 
"Tonga’s INDC will also require basic information and data so that they can be understood clearly by key stakeholders to achieve consensus in setting realistic emission reduction targets and smart resilience investments. The intended contribution also include adaptation, mitigation and means of implementation: TSDF national planning framework with its national goal to achieve a more inclusive, sustainable and effective land administration, environment management, and resilience to climate and risk, finance initiatives and capacity building.", 
"Overall, Tonga’s INDCs should raise the Kingdom ambition to contribute towards a robust and ambitious legally binding COP21 climate change agreement.", "Section 1: Introduction ", "This island Kingdom of Tonga is located in the Central South Pacific. It lies between 15° and 23° 30’ South and 173° and 177° West. Tonga consists of four clusters of islands extended over a north-south axis: Tongatapu (260sqkm) and ‘Eua (87sqkm) in the south, Ha’apai (109sqkm) in the middle, Vava’u (121sqkm) in the north and Niuafo’ou and Niuatoputapu (72sqkm) in the far north. Nuku’alofa, the capital is situated in Tongatapu, the largest island.", 
"Tonga’s archipelago is situated within 200km of the subduction zone of the Indian- Australian and the Pacific tectonic plates which is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire where intense seismic activities occur and a potential source of tsunami. Most of its atoll islands including the main island are very flat with an average altitude of 2–5 meters and hence Tonga is highly vulnerable to sea level rise, storm surges and tsunami inundation.", "In June 2012, the population of Tonga was estimated at 103,219 which is five times higher than 1901, with most of this growth existed between the 1930s and 1970s. Tongatapu is the most populous island and has the highest population density. Increased population, along with urbanisation and development has resulted in substantial pressure on, and degradation of, land and marine resources. This in turn has reduced the resilience of Tonga’s environment and its people to climate change impacts and disaster risks.", 
"Since June 2013, Tonga moved from a lower middle to upper middle-income bracket, with a nominal GDP per capita for 2013/14 of about $7,636 or about US$3,800. Because of Tonga's large receipts of remittances, running at over 20% of GDP, Gross National Income (GNI) per capita (about US$4,500 in 2013) is a better measure of the actual income going to Tongans. Since 2005 Tonga’s GNI per capita has grown considerably faster than the average for the region, increasing from about the same as the regional average to 35 percent greater. However, these figures are average figures for Tonga and do not give a clear indication of distribution or inequality. The latest Household Income Expenditure Survey (HIES) of 2009 indicates an increase in the percentage of the population living below the poverty line increasing to 22.5 percent compared to 16.2 percent in the 2001 HIES. The increase was greatest on the outer islands increasing from 11.8 to 22.9 percent.", 
"The current anthropogenic greenhouse gases and warming of the atmosphere have negatively impacted Tonga’s environment, its people and their livelihoods. The most recent report from the Pacific-Australia Climate Change Science and Adaptation Planning Program (PACCSAP) provided the following future projections to 2100 for Tonga:", "", "El Niño and La Niña events will continue to occur in the future (very high confidence), but there is little consensus on whether these events will change in intensity or frequency;",

"Sea level will continue to rise (very high confidence).", "", "Recent climate and weather events in Tonga, particularly in Ha’apai (a sequence of drought, Cyclone Ian, and further drought), are a window to a future that will increasingly involve multiple stresses from the above (1-6) along with the pre-existing environmental, social, and economic stresses. Building greater resilience to existing extreme natural events and the threat of climate change is essential to ensure the sustainable progress that is desired. These and other potential threats require Tonga to become better equipped to plan and respond o the unexpected.

When land use and forestry is taken into account, Tonga is a net carbon sink, with its forests absorbing substantially more greenhouse gas emissions than is emitted through all other sources. Nonetheless, as a country with much at stake in regard to climate change and variability and natural hazards, Tonga is strongly committed to climate change mitigation. Its primary focus on poverty alleviation and climate resilient development has many co-benefits in the area of mitigation.", 
"The sectoral breakdown in Figure 1 shows the energy sector, with transport (primarily land based transport) then electricity generation as the highest sources of emissions, followed by the agriculture and waste sectors.", "Figure 1: Breakdown of Tonga’s GHG emissions, excluding land use change and forestry (LUCF) (2006 GHG Inventory) ", "", "Within land use change and forestry, forest and grassland conversion of biomass represents a source of slightly larger magnitude than energy industries and transport combined. However, this is offset by removals from forests, making Tonga a net carbon sink overall, in the order of 1691.97 Gg CO2e.", 
"Thus, the reduction of emissions from the energy sector, and the maintenance of Tonga’s forest resources and preservation of forest ecosystem services for a climate resilient future should be the primary focus of mitigation actions into the future.", "Energy: Electricity Generation ", "The dominance of energy as a GHG emitting sector underscores Tonga’s current reliance on imported oil for its development needs, which supplies all transport fuel, much of the energy for water pumping, and over 90% of grid-supplied electricity. As a consequence, the Tongan economy and electricity consumers in particular have been exposed to high and volatile electricity prices linked to oil prices over the last fifteen years. This is more acute than some other larger Pacific Island countries, as Tonga does not have hydropower potential.", 
"Energy is a fundamental building block for the Kingdom in its social and economic development and in enhancing the livelihood and wellbeing of all Tongans. Accessible and affordable electricity that is environmentally responsible and commercially viable is considered a key catalyst for sustainable economic growth. Further, accessible, affordable and sustainable electricity is crucial to achieve the Government's primary target of ‘poverty alleviation’ including increasing access to electricity from 89 to 100%. Increased access to electricity, along with additional growth in commercial and residential demand was forecast in 2010 to lead to a 50% increase in electricity consumption by 2020 in the absence of action on renewable energy and energy efficiency.", 
"This reliance on oil imports is incompatible with the aspirational goal of the Tonga Climate Change Policy, to achieve a resilient Tonga by 2035. Recognising the issue as a matter of national significance, in 2010 the Tongan Government released the Tonga Energy Road Map (TERM) 2010-2020 a “ten year road map to reduce Tonga’s vulnerability to oil price shocks and to achieve an increase in quality access to modern energy services in an environmentally sustainable manner”.", "Under the Roadmap, Tonga’s initial target was to supply 50% of electricity generation through renewable resources by 2020. Furthermore, reducing the level of electricity network losses to reach at most 10% of total electricity generation in the country. While the targets were ambitious, it represented a clear direction and indication from the Government that reducing the vulnerability of the country to future oil price shocks is a key objective, and that renewable energy is expected to be a major element of a strategy to enhance energy security and reduce climate change for the Kingdom. There is already a plan to increase from 50% to 100% of RE in total electricity production by 2030. The Government has been proactively working towards the RE target, with over a million litres of diesel fuel oil projected to be saved per annum from March 2015. The Government also aims to replace all diesel-based water pumping engines by 2017 using solar power.", 
"Implementation of the Tonga Energy Road Map will help Tonga to achieve its energy strategic objectives of accessible to affordable energy prices, improve accessible to clean energy and reliable power supply. That will lead to increased economic growth, which improve quality of life for all Tongans.", "Energy: Transport ", "While transport fuel (primarily for land transport) is the largest component of energy sector emissions and the biggest driver of oil imports, it is not currently covered by the Roadmap. Due to the lack of available technological solutions for the transport sector and limited national focus on this area to date, the ability to quantify the mitigation potential or cost associated with the transport sector opportunities is limited. However, the Government of Tonga is in the process of developing transport sector measures to include in the TERM strategies, and has undertaken training and public awareness actions on vehicle maintenance, public transport and bicycle usage. The Kingdom is particularly interested in biofuels for both transport and electricity generation, developed in alignment with Tonga’s resilience focus, ensuring sustainable production and replanting. Tonga is participating in regional transport sector mitigation efforts being developed by the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, and welcomes international assistance in the development of meaningful and wide ranging mitigation opportunities to reduce Tonga’s oil dependence and GHG emissions in this sector. This is crucial for a resilient Tonga, especially the plan to include diesel engines efficiency services training to help reduce fossil fuel consumption in the country. Furthermore, the identified private sector interest on solar car public transport campaign for tourists would help add values to reducing petroleum consumption in the sector. Refer to transport actions included in Annex 2.", 
"Land Use Change and Forestry ", "As identified in Section 4, the National Forest Policy (2010) is of particular importance in terms of adaptation and mitigation co-benefits.

These will form part of an unquantified mitigation contribution, as mentioned in Section 6.", "Agriculture ", 
"Emissions in the agriculture sector are principally a function of livestock numbers. Some mitigation co-benefits may result from plans to enhance the climate resilience of the agriculture sector (e.g. through improved soil management practices, development of agro-forestry systems, and increased use of biogas systems that also provide organic fertilizers). Additionally, improvements in animal welfare through greater water availability to stock and improvements in feed quality could likely lead to reduced methane emissions.",

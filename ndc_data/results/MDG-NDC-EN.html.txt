Due to its geographical position, the island frequently experiences extreme weather events that significantly affect its national economy, as well as the population’s livelihood. Climate change impacts, particularly severe during the last two decades, are: (1) extended drought periods; (2) increased variability of the rainfall regime; (3) intensification of cyclones; (4) floods associated with cyclone disturbances.", 
"Madagascar is equally committed to contribute to mitigate climate change, as well as to reduce climate change vulnerability and promote adaptation measures, although the importance of the two complementary strategies is different. Moreover, the choice of the identified adaptation sectors (agriculture, coastal zone management, human health), as well as ecosystem based adaptation approach (forests, mangroves, biodiversity, water resources) can have significant benefits on the mitigation. In fact, these actions may contribute to the strengthening of carbon stocks. Forests and mangroves sustainable management, in addition to greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction associated with deforestation limitation, can specifically illustrate this link.", 
"Madagascar is a least developed country with non-significant greenhouse gases emissions. Primary sectors, particularly agriculture and fisheries, are prominent in the national economy. Furthermore, the country has an exceptional biodiversity that need to be preserved. In this context, approximately 7 million hectares, representing 11.9% of national territory is declared protected areas, as of May 2015. Electrification level is extremely low, with about 20% of households benefiting from electric lightning. This explains its dependence on fuelwood, which will persist in the medium term.",

In 2030, Madagascar aims to reduce approximately 30 MtCO2 of its emissions of GHG, representing 14% of national emissions, compared to the BAU scenario, with projections based of GHG inventory from year 2000 to 2010. This reduction is additive to the absorptions increase of the LULUCF sector, which estimated at 61 MtCO2 in 2030. Total increase in GHG absorption is expected at 32%, compared to the BAU scenario.", 
"However, these objectives remain conditioned by financial support, which will be received from global partners (conditional contributions). Madagascar relies on the international community support to reach this objective through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and other existing or future financial mechanisms.

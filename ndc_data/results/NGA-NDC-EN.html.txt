Nigeria is a lower middle income developing country, the GDP per capita in current US$ is about $2,950. The economy is diversifying and has grown over 6% per year for the past decade. Yet, significant challenges remain. Food insecurity, poor access to energy and high unemployment, amongst others, remain principal constraints on economic development and are of primary concern to the government. Those below the poverty line of US$1.25 PPP still make up 30% of the population. The recent sharp decline in world oil prices has put pressure on the federal government budget, which continues to depend significantly on export revenues. The Nigeria INDC, therefore, focuses on the delivery of direct development benefits and sustainable growth of the economy.",

Under a business-as-usual scenario, agricultural productivity could decline between 10 to 25 per cent by 2080. In some parts of the north, the decline in yield in rain fed agriculture could be as much as 50 percent. This in turn would impact GDP, reducing it by as much as 4.5 percent by 2050,[3] even though the share of agriculture in GDP will decline from 40 to just 15 percent.

"", "", "Water: A considerable proportion of the population is at risk of water stress, with less than 40% having direct access to potable water. Climate change brings increased variability in rainfall, resulting in flooding in some humid areas in the south in the country and a decrease in precipitation in the savannah north. This may result in droughts and decrease in surface water resources in the north. It is possible that changes in surface runoff and groundwater flows in shallow aquifers can be linked to climate variability with long-term implications for permanent and seasonal water bodies. The rapid shrinking of Lake Chad from about 45,000 km2 in 1960 to less than 3,000 km2 in 2007 is mainly attributed to changes in the climatic conditions in the region. Hydro-electric power generation suffers frequently from low in-flow into the dams and water transportation along inland channels has also been negatively impacted.

This growth will have a strong impact on future emissions. Following careful review of the re-based GDP data for 2010-2014[4] and official population projections the “business-as-usual scenario” was developed as part of the preparation of this INDC. This scenario assumes an economic growth at 5%, population growing at about 2.5% per year, all Nigerians to have access to electricity (both on-grid and off-grid) and demand is met, industry triples its size by 2030. Under this scenario, emissions are projected to grow 114% by 2030 to around 900 million tonnes - around 3.4 tonnes for every Nigerian. Under a high growth scenario, with economic growth at 7%, this climbs to over one billion tonnes.", 
"3.2 Mitigation potential assessment", "The mitigation actions, which could be undertaken, were assessed in a bottom up manner, building on expert assessments of both the challenges facing individual sectors, as well as a review of policies and measures already in place. The measures included in Nigeria’s INDC are expected to deliver significant development benefits. The mitigation actions that bring the largest development benefit are reducing air pollution, indoors and outdoors, with enormous immediate health and social benefits. Secondly, innovation in “clean” technologies brings resource efficiency and produces more knowledge and jobs than those in “dirty” technologies. Thirdly, fiscal reform is proving an efficient mitigation action. This releases significant resources in the budget that can fund investments in efficient infrastructure and other fiscal policies, thus creating jobs and fuelling growth. Beyond mitigation actions that could be quantified, several qualitative policies and measures have been identified.", 
"3.3 Unconditional contribution", "In the event an ambitious, comprehensive legally binding global agreement is reached at COP21 in Paris, Nigeria will make an unconditional contribution of 20 per cent below BAU that is consistent with the current development trends and government policy priorities.

"", "4.2.1 Agriculture, forests and land use change", "The livelihoods of Nigeria’s poorest farmers are already at risk from climate change. Rising temperatures, too little rain or too much rain, thriving pests all lead to crop losses. Without access to improved seeds, fertilizer and appropriate technologies, such as irrigation systems and finance, Nigeria’s food security will be at risk. With growing food demand from a growing population, declining harvests would strain supply, increasing malnutrition and possibly reverse recent progress in alleviating poverty. Improving agriculture is a central part of Vision 20:2020. The ambitions laid down in the Agricultural Transformation Agenda (ATA) cannot, however, be met without climate smart agriculture (CSA). CSA seeks to address the combined challenges of food security and climate change. Its aims are to sustainably increase agricultural productivity and support equitable increases in farm incomes, enhancing food security and development. It is also aimed at adapting and building resilience of agricultural and food security systems to climate change, thus, reducing greenhouse gas emissions from crops, livestock and fisheries. Farmers take agro-ecological measures that increase the resilience of the farming systems, as opposed to such measures that promote high external input farming, industrial meat production and large-scale industrial agriculture, which contribute to climate change. The benefits of improved practices go beyond improved yields. With improved yields come improved diets, growing productivity and reinvestment in rural communities, it puts children back in school. Improved productivity results in reduced food imports and reduced emissions. Appropriate incentives to farmers, and training, will be important. The best incentive for farmers is likely to come in the form of improved yields. Ultimately, the livelihoods of the poorest farmers are secured, as is security at large. This is important even though the share of the sector in the economy is reducing.", 
"One example is agroforestry, where trees are mixed with crops and animals on the same land, can be another option for carbon fixing and for providing mulch material. Estimates of the benefits from agroforestry range from total (lifetime) emissions reductions of 158 million tonnes to 712 million tonnes. Another example is a reduction of methane emissions from livestock, through improved feeding and breeding.", "Halting deforestation and the conservation of remaining natural forests, as well as reversing forest degradation is important. A failure to do so undermines the productive capacity of the land, as well as key ecosystems. The use of fuel wood and charcoal for fuel is also a major source of degradation of Nigeria’s forests. By some estimates, at the current rate of deforestation, there will be no significant forest remaining in a few years’ time, unless strong action is taken. It must, however, be recognized that charcoal provides essential fuel for many in Nigeria and its use cannot simply be reduced without providing alternatives. Efficient cookstoves are one way to reduce fuel demand, and alternative heating sources such as LPG could be provided. To what extent the use of LPG - a fossil fuel - delivers a genuine climate benefit, compared to wood-based charcoal, needs to be considered. Further work is needed in this regard.", 
"The overall cost per tonne of mitigation achieved in the sector is assumed to be negligible because the non-carbon benefits of the measures justify the costs. However, farmers may need assistance, because there may, for example, be upfront costs which low-income farmers will need help to meet.", "4.2.2 Gas Flaring", "The flaring of associated gas is illegal, the reality is a different one. There is a lack of gas infrastructure, until recently a relative lack of domestic demand for natural gas, and no transparent gas market. It has also been suggested that the subsidization of other fuels makes gas less attractive than it should be. Penalties are low and enforcement weak, the benefits of utilization accrue elsewhere. As a result of the foregoing, the companies responsible for ending the flaring have at present little incentive to do so. Gas flaring was responsible for around 48 million tonnes of emissions in 2010 [7]. Yet it is possible and cost-effective to Nigeria to reduce and ultimately end the practice.", 
"There are many potential productive uses for this gas such as feeding industrial clusters with a centralized gas supply. This would combine well with other options, such as increased use of natural gas (e.g. CNG) in transport and in power generation. The key difficulty may be enforcement, but the benefits are large. Eliminating flaring by 2030 could save around 64 million tonnes of CO2 per year.[8] The World Bank estimates that this would have a net benefit of $61 per tonne. It could combine well with other mitigation measures such as substitution of natural gas-fired electricity generation for diesel generators.", 
"4.2.3 Energy", "The government has made addressing the need to provide access to energy for all Nigerians a priority. At present, a significant share of demand for energy, and electricity in particular, remains unmet. The current grid is unable to reliably serve the existing industrial and urban customer base. A shortfall in generation capacity has led to the proliferation of small generators, which are inefficient and polluting. Most rural communities remain off the grid, about 60% of the population lack access to electricity. At the current rate of grid expansion they will largely remain under-served. The potential to both provide energy access and to reduce emissions is enormous. The mitigation options for energy address both energy demand and energy supply.", 
"", "This can be achieved through implementation of three significant policies. Firstly, reliable gas-powered generation, using associated gas currently flared, can replace small generators. Secondly, rural electrification will be driven by cost-efficient renewable solutions. Thirdly, energy efficiency is greatly improved so as to reduce overall demand for energy and in doing so serve more people, faster.", "", "In many cases, energy efficiency measures are cost-effective. Yet, the upfront costs of these measures can be an important challenge. In the short-term, it is usually more expensive to purchase efficient equipment than to keep older equipment operating. Nigeria’s National Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Action Plan looked at a 40% energy efficiency target for the country, equivalent to around 2.5% improvement per year. This leads to a reduction in energy demand as shown in Figure 3 below.", 
"Figure 3: Energy demand – business as usual versus efficient green scenarios", "", "By abandoning the grid-paradigm and investing in the provision of energy for poor communities, the development potential of two thirds of Nigerians is unleashed. At present, poor Nigerians pay a significant “poverty penalty” in order to meet their energy needs. They pay proportionately more for energy, spend more time acquiring fuels, and suffer the health impacts from poor fuel quality. This puts a significant brake on development and the empowerment of women in particular. Importantly, reduced dependence on fossil resources can also increase security. A further benefit of rural electrification on- and off-grid using renewable solutions is that many small entrepreneurs can find work in the sector. Several projects and studies are under way in the area of pay-as-you-go and leasing contracts with small down payments, as well as micro-finance options for SME entrepreneurs.", 
"Renewable electricity generation is a financially attractive option in Nigeria. This is particularly true for those households that are not connected to the national electricity grid. Analysis shows that renewable energy presents a significant saving over diesel generators. [9]", "The use of more efficient gas power stations, small-scale stations near a source of gas, or replacing existing diesel generation with natural gas, is also attractive, especially so when a station is refurbished, as the cost of the alternative is higher.[10]", 
"", "Savings could also be made by reducing losses from the electricity transmission network.", "Finally, the removal of consumer and producer subsidies for fossil fuels can help stabilize government budgets. While intended to reduce the cost of living for the poor, these subsidies have ended up mostly benefiting the rich.", "4.2.4 Transport and Infrastructure", "The current state of infrastructure in the country is inadequate. The road system is overburdened and poorly maintained. The fast-growing economy has brought many more cars on the road, traveling more miles. Past attempts to improve infrastructure seem to have failed due to policy inconsistency, poor maintenance and poor accountability. Recently, significant new investments in rail transport have been initiated.", 
"Many of the mitigation options can be summarized as “modal shift” - moving passengers or freight from one form or mode of transport to another, less polluting, one. Air pollution in major urban areas is severe and the health benefits of these measures immediate. For example, when High Speed Rail (HSR) is available in Nigeria, a shift from air travel to HSR could begin. Significant investments are being made to revive rail transport, which also has the potential to carry a share of the fast-growing cargo load. With the early stage status of the high speed rail network in Nigeria, it is not possible to quantify the costs and potential accurately.", 
"Measures to increase the efficiency of existing vehicles and the transport system are also possible. Improvements in urban transit systems are difficult to quantify. The price of travel can be adjusted to make it more reflective of the true cost. Initiatives to deliver this aim include road pricing and reform of subsidies.", "In addition to improved maintenance and a modal shift for cargo, the most direct benefits would be seen from the introduction of fuel efficiency standards and the use of LPG / CNG for buses and taxis.", 
"4.2.5 Manufacturing", "Diversification of the economy is a priority for the government of Nigeria. Over 90% of Nigerian businesses are micro- and small enterprises. Their success is key to alleviating the rural areas. Enabling high unemployment, especially prevalent among youth entrepreneurs thrive, especially in smaller towns requires investment in basic infrastructure.", "Industrial productivity, in general, has been most significantly impacted by unreliable electricity supply. Nigerian companies also face stiff low-cost competition from consumer goods produced elsewhere. The regulatory environment can be tough to navigate. Domestic demand, however, is growing steadily and has driven significant new investment in key manufacturing sectors.", 
"As Nigeria develops economically, emissions from its industry can be expected to grow significantly. This economic development is welcome and will bring benefits for all Nigerians. At present, the majority of emissions in the sector are from the cement and oil and gas industry. In the future other industries might contribute a greater proportion than today. In the absence of an efficiency mind-set and lack of efficiency benchmarks or standards this might lead to exponential emissions growth in the sector. The use of best available technology at the time of construction of a new industrial facility will reduce future fuel demands and emissions. In addition, in most cases the use of best practice technology will lead to lower lifetime costs for the businesses involved. The issue can be upfront capital - ability to pay a possibly higher initial cost for the best available equipment, even if this would be recouped over time with lower running costs. Well-functioning financial markets are essential for this - consideration could also be given to some form of industrial development “soft” loans, repayable as the equipment is used.", 
"4.2.6 Short-lived pollutants and air quality", "Poor air quality is the bane of urban residents and a health threat. Drastic measures to reduce soot (black carbon) pollution from cars and trucks, small generators and industry are needed. Failure to do so could make Nigeria’s mega-cities unliveable. This includes enforcement of the importation ban of cars over 15 years’ old, stricter inspections, and further consideration of setting efficiency standards for new cars similar to those in South Korea.", 
"Those who rely on fuel wood and charcoal for cooking and heating, primarily women, are exposed to serious indoor air pollution. Providing affordable clean alternatives is the only way forward.", "Other short-lived pollutants with a high global warming impact, such as industrial gasses, are not produced in Nigeria. Here the adoption of standards for imported equipment will be considered, in particular in the field of refrigeration and air conditioning where there is a risk of dumping of HCFC and HFC installations that are being phased out in OECD countries. Methane emissions are discussed in the section on gas flaring.", 
"4.2.7 Climate smart cities", "Lagos, Kano and Abuja are among the fastest growing cities globally. Keeping them liveable is a major challenge. Providing basic infrastructure, like potable water, waste and sewerage services, affordable housing, electricity, roads and transit services puts a strain on government at all levels. There is, however, a growing movement to improve urban livelihoods through integrated planning focusing on creating workable communities that are affordable to lower middle income families. This requires innovative financial products catering to families underserved by banks.", 
"Lagos in particular is already strongly impacted by flooding. The government is investing to make the city more resilient to climate change. Reducing the environmental footprint of mega-cities will, for example, require promulgating new housing standards. The transit system, building on lessons learned from the introduction of BRT, needs maintenance and investment. Highway expansion may be financed through tolls. Waste management systems are strained, improvements in this area have immediate benefits for health and quality of life.[11]", 
"4.2.8 Gender impacts and Social inclusion", "The degree to which people are affected by climate change impacts is influenced by their social status, gender, wealth, political power and access to and control over resources. Women and youth, but also remote communities, still have less economic, political and legal clout than, for example, men and the urban middle class. They are more directly impacted and less able to cope with climate impacts. At the same time, mitigation measures can empower these groups that are socio-economically disadvantaged in a differentiated manner. An example is the poverty penalty paid by households in search of potable water and fuel wood. Women benefit most from clean efficient cook stoves, gaining in health and in productive time where these are introduced. They, however, have difficulty accessing financial institutions. Similarly, agricultural extension services have proven to reach more men than women. New policies and measures need to be assessed against their ability to bring social inclusion and be culturally appropriate, as well as improve livelihood security, increase resilience and reduce emissions. The measures included in the Nigeria INDC were deemed to at a minimum be gender neutral and / or to enhance social inclusion.", 
"5 Methodology and Information to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding", "5.1 Transparency", "The Lima Call to Climate Action suggested a list of information that countries can include in INDCs to ensure transparency and understanding. Nigeria is fully committed to increasing transparency. This INDC contains key data that may enable independent assessment of ambition and compatibility through full transparency.

Nigeria is a low middle income country with a large, fast growing population. Without ambitious mitigation action, Nigeria’s per capita emissions are projected to grow to 3.4 tonnes CO2e. Coming from a low development base, emissions from Nigeria’s conditional contribution are expected to stabilize slightly above today’s level of 2 tonnes per capita, once the full package of policies and measures has been implemented with international support. Global per capita emissions need to converge around 2 tonnes per capita by 2050. The Government of Nigeria considers, therefore, that its contribution is in line with its common, but differentiated responsibility and respective capability and makes a fair and ambitious contribution to the global effort to prevent dangerous climate change.",

"7 INDC Implementation", "INDC implementation will fall under the remit of the Nigeria Climate Change Policy Response and Strategy (NCCPRS) adopted in 2012, in line with the strategic goal to foster low-carbon, high growth economic development and build a climate resilient society. Implementation will be taken forward by existing governance arrangements under the NCCPRS, with coordination being managed by the Department of Climate Change. The appropriate line ministries and agencies will carry out specific implementation activities.", 
"The implementation of the full contribution is conditional on the availability of adequate financing for investment in the mitigation actions contained therein. The INDC can provide public and private sector investors with a road map for Nigeria’s development. Nigeria welcomes support for mitigation policies and measures in the form of direct investments and loans. Finance and investment can come from both public and private sources, including the Green Climate Fund and international financial institutions, such as the World Bank, IFC and AfDB. The international bilateral sources should include reliable, new and additional ODA. Contingent on agreement in Paris, it may also include financing through carbon market mechanisms.", 
"International finance and investment, technology and capacity-building will be needed to achieve the ambitious intended contribution. Further work is needed to determine the exact domestic share of the full contribution, as well as the total investment required. We will seek to specify the technical support and capacity building needs in support of the achievement of the policies and measure as soon as possible. To this end, a strategic plan to guide INDC implementation shall be developed. The aim of this plan would be to improve cross-sectoral coordination and policy coherence, as well as enforcement of existing measures.

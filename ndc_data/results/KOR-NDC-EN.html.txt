Planning Process", "2.1 Planning Process for the 2030 mitigation target", "In preparation of its INDC, Korea established a dedicated task force comprising relevant ministries, including the Ministry of Environment (MOE) and the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE), chaired by the Prime Minister’s Office.", 
"A technical analysis for setting the 2030 mitigation target was conducted by a Joint Working Group of national research institutions, including the Greenhouse Gas Inventory &amp; Research Center of Korea (GIR) and the Korea Energy Economics Institute (KEEI).", "The results of the technical analysis of the Joint Working Group were reviewed by a group of experts put forward by different stakeholder groups such as business and civil society. The Korean government also collected feedback from various stakeholders through public hearings and a forum hosted by the National Assembly.", 
"On that basis, the 2030 mitigation target was reviewed by the Committee on Green Growth, and finalized in accordance with national authorization procedures.", "2.2 Sectoral measures for mitigation", "Korea announced its voluntary mitigation target in 2009 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% from the business-as-usual (BAU) level by 2020. The target was stipulated in the Framework Act on Low Carbon, Green Growth which came into effect in April 2010.", 
"Furthermore, Korea has continued its efforts to provide a legislative framework and national plans for addressing climate change. The Korean government finalized sectoral and annual targets in July 2011, and announced the National Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Roadmap in January 2014 for sectoral action plans and their implementation.", "In 2012, Korea launched the GHG and Energy Target Management System (TMS) for the industrial sector. The reduction through the TMS exceeded its industrial sectoral target for mitigation. In promoting cost-effective measures for mitigation, Korea adopted the Act on the Allocation and Trading of Greenhouse Gas Emission Permits in 2012, and launched a nation-wide Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) in 2015. The ETS covers 525 business entities which account for 67.7% of national greenhouse gas emissions.", 
"Korea obligated the power generators to supply a portion of electricity from renewable sources and is increasing the production of renewable energy in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel.

"In the transport sector, the Korean government is continuing to expand infrastructure for environment- friendly public transportation, while introducing low-carbon standards for fuel efficiency and emissions produced from automobiles. The Korean government has decided to strengthen the average emission standard from 140g/km in 2015 to 97g/km in 2020. The Korean government provides various incentives, including tax reductions for electric and hybrid vehicles in order to promote low-carbon vehicles.", 
"While implementing sectoral measures for mitigation, Korea established a domestic measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) system to monitor businesses with large amounts of greenhouse gas emissions in the industry, power generation, building and transport sectors.", "2.3 Follow-up for the implementation of the 2030 mitigation target", "The Korean government will develop a detailed plan to implement the mitigation target in consultation with relevant stakeholders, once the mitigation target is finalized at the international level.",

Fairness and Ambition", "Korea accounts for approximately 1.4% of global greenhouse gas emissions (including LULUCF, according to the WRI CAIT 3.0), but has set a fair and ambitious target to the extent possible. Korea will make continued efforts to implement the mitigation target.", "Korea’s mitigation potential is limited due to its industrial structure with a large share of manufacturing (32% as of 2012) and the high energy efficiency of major industries. Given the decreased level of public acceptance following the Fukushima accident, there are now limits to the extent that Korea can make use of nuclear energy, one of the major mitigation measures available to it.", 
"Despite the challenges, Korea has set a target for 2030, which is expected to be in line with the recommendations of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by 40-70% from 2010 levels by 2050.", "In order to achieve the objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change of holding the increase in the global average temperature below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, Korea also aims to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in a manner consistent with the recommendations of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report.",

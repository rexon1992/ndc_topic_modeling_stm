<h2><a id="INTENDED_NATIONALLY_DETERMINED_CONTRIBUTION_4"></a>INTENDED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION</h2>
<p>In accordance with decisions 1/CP.19 and 1/CP.20, the Republic of Turkey hereby presents its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) towards achieving the ultimate objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change which is set out in its Article 2 and clarifying information.</p>
<h3><a id="National_Circumstances_13"></a>National Circumstances</h3>
<p>Turkey achieved 230 per cent increase in GDP between 1990 and 2012. Its population has increased more than 30 per cent since 1990. Turkey’s energy demand increases by 6-7 percent every year.</p>
<p>Turkey is an upper-middle income developing country according to the World Bank classification. Turkey remains eligible to official development assistance (ODA).</p>
<p>Turkey is listed in Annex I to the UNFCCC. However, Decision 1/CP.16 recognized the special circumstances of Turkey and placed Turkey in a different situation than the other Parties included in Annex I.</p>
<p>Turkey aims to contribute to the collective efforts to combat climate change in line with its national circumstances and capabilities.</p>
<p>With this perspective, National Strategy on Climate Change and National Climate Change Action Plan were adopted in 2010 and 2011 respectively.</p>
<p>National Climate Change Action Plan consists of emission control and adaptation policies and measures which are being implemented in all relevant sectors.</p>
<p>The greenhouse gas inventory of the year 2012 revealed that the total emissions in 2012 expressed in CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent were 440 million tons in Turkey. The energy sector had the largest share with 70.2 percent. Industrial processes with 14.3 percent, waste sector with 8.2 percent and agriculture with 7.3 percent followed the energy sector. Turkey’s per capita greenhouse gas (GHG) emission for the same year was 5.9 ton CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent, which is much lower than the EU and OECD average.</p>
<h3><a id="Information_on_INDC_31"></a>Information on INDC</h3>
<h4><a id="INDC_34"></a>INDC</h4>
<p><strong>Up to 21 percent reduction in GHG emissions from the Business as Usual (BAU) level by 2030.</strong></p>
<h4><a id="Period_for_Implementation_or_Contribution_38"></a>Period for Implementation or Contribution</h4>
<p>2021-2030</p>
<h4><a id="Scope_and_Coverage_42"></a>Scope and Coverage</h4>
<p>Economy-wide.<br>
Energy, industrial processes and products use, agriculture, land use<br>
land-use change and forestry, and waste sectors.</p>
<h4><a id="GHGs_47"></a>GHGs</h4>
<p>All greenhouse gases included in the national inventory:</p>
<ul>
<li>Carbon dioxide (СО2);</li>
<li>Methane (СН4);</li>
<li>Nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O);</li>
<li>Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs);</li>
<li>Perfluorocarbons (PFCs);</li>
<li>Sulfur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>);</li>
<li>Nitrous trifluoride (NF<sub>3</sub>).</li>
</ul>
<h4><a id="Methodological_approaches_57"></a>Methodological approaches</h4>
<p>Methodological approaches are based on using the IPCC 2006 Guidelines and IPCC 2013 KP Supplement.<br>
Global warming potential on a 100 year timescale in accordance with the IPCC’s 4th Assessment Report.</p>
<h4><a id="Use_of_International_Market_Mechanisms_62"></a>Use of International Market Mechanisms</h4>
<p>Turkey aims to use carbon credits from international market mechanisms to achieve its 2030 mitigation target in a cost effective manner and in accordance with the relevant rules and standards.</p>
<h4><a id="Consideration_of_fairness_and_ambition_based_on_national_conditions_64"></a>Consideration of fairness and ambition based on national conditions</h4>
<p>Turkey has to continue its sustainable development process.<br>
Rapid industrialization and urbanization have been taking place in Turkey over the last 30 years.<br>
Turkey is responsible for only 0.7 percent of the global emissions since the industrial revolution.<br>
Energy imports have a significant share in Turkey’s account deficit. Turkey has to use its limited energy resources.<br>
Turkey experiences financial and technological constraints in combating climate change.<br>
This INDC provides additional policies, plans and measures in many sectors.</p>
<h4><a id="How_the_INDC_contributes_to_achieving_the_ultimate_objective_of_the_Convention_Article_2_71"></a>How the INDC contributes to achieving the ultimate objective of the Convention (Article 2)</h4>
<p>Up to 21 percent reduction in GHG emissions from the BAU level by 2030 will enable Turkey to step on low-carbon development pathways compatible with the long-term objective of limiting the increase in global temperature below 2°C.</p>
<h4><a id="Planning_Process_74"></a>Planning Process</h4>
<p><strong>Turkey may revise this INDC in accordance with changing circumstances.</strong><br>
Turkey supports its INDC through a national climate change policy which includes;</p>
<ul>

<li>National Strategy on Climate Change</li>
<li>National Climate Change Action Plan</li>
<li>National Strategy on Industry</li>

</ul>
<p>Turkey’s INDC was prepared in a participatory approach through multiple stakeholder meetings and by analytical studies conducted for 1 year.<br>
Times-MACRO model is used for energy related modeling and other national models and studies are used for non-energy sectors.</p>
<h4><a id="Financial_Needs_92"></a>Financial Needs</h4>

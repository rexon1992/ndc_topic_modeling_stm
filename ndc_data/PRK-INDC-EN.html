<p><strong>September 2016 </strong></p>
<h2 id="background">1. Background </h2>
<p>The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPR Korea) has always paid a great attention to the environment protection work in constructing the socialist power.</p>
<p>The respected Comrade <strong>Kim Jong Un</strong> said:</p>
<p>“Environmental protection work should be improved so as to protect and increase the country’s resources and keep its air, rivers and seas completely free from pollution”</p>
<p>Under the wise guidance of the respected Comrade <strong>Kim Jong Un</strong>, chairman of the State Affairs Commission of DPR Korea, the Republic recently has made much progress in conducting the forest restoration campaign, thus has achieved a great success in establishing the sufficient material and technical foundation for environment protection, afforestation and enclosing-with-park throughout the country. Besides, large or medium and small hydro power stations including the Paektusan Hero Youth Power Station were constructed and much progress has been made in improving the efficiency of electricity generation and consumption, as well as in scaling up the utilization of the renewable energy. All these efforts resulted in the advances towards the protection of air pollution and climate change.</p>
<p>Many scientific and technological advances including the cycling production system in agricultural sector and zero-energy, zero-carbon architecture in construction sector have been achieved so as to accelerate the sustainable development of social and economic sectors.</p>
<p>In addition, DPR Korea has established the legal and policy framework to respond the climate change by supplementing the Law on Environment Protection with the contents related to climate change and newly enacting the Law on Environment Impact Assessment.</p>
<p>Especially, in order to contribute to international efforts to address climate change issues, DPR Korea ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on 5 December 1994, the Kyoto Protocol on 27 April 2005 and the Paris Agreement on 1 August 2016.</p>
<p>As a non-Annex I Party, DPR Korea prepared the First National Communication and Second National Communication in cooperation with the UNEP and under the coordination of the National Coordinating Committee for Environment, and submitted them to the UNFCCC secretariat respectively in September 2002 and February 2013.</p>
<p>DPR Korea is now making progress towards initiating the enabling activities to prepare the Third National Communication and the First Biennial Update Report under international support.</p>
<p>In 1999, the least-cost GHG abatement strategy was developed under the support of the UNDP/GEF.</p>
<p>Integrating climate change considerations into relevant socio-economic development strategies and plans is considered as one of the important measures to ensure the sustainable development in DPR Korea. Especially in accordance with five-year strategy for national economic development, national energy and climate change issues are simultaneously to be addressed by improving the efficiency of electric power generating facilities and by scaling up the utilization of renewable energy.</p>
<p>Pursuant to decisions 1/CP.19, 1/CP.20 and 1/CP.21 of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC, the Government of the DPR Korea is pleased to prepare its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC). DPR Korea’s INDC includes a mitigation and an adaptation component.</p>
<p>The mitigation component includes both unconditional and conditional contributions. The unconditional contributions are measures that will be implemented using domestic resources. With domestic resources, GHG emissions will be reduced by 8.0% by 2030 compared to the Business as Usual scenario (BAU). The conditional contributions are measures that could be implemented if additional international financial support, technology transfer and capacity building are received. The national contribution could be increased up to 40.25% with international support.</p>
<p>The adaptation component describes the adaptation needs raised in terms of institutional arrangement, financing, capacity building and technology transfer by 2030. It also presents the prioritized adaptation measures.</p>
<p>When considering the development priorities and adaptation needs in DPR Korea as one of developing countries, international support for developing countries under the Paris Agreement is required to encourage DPR Korea to scale up his mitigation measures to the level contributable to addressing climate change, an international issue on a global scale.</p>
<p>DPR Korea will continue to make efforts to achieve the contribution beyond the level committed in this report, based on the effective mobilization of domestic resources and international support, and thus will actively contribute to achieving the objectives of the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement.</p>

<h3 id="fair-and-ambitious">2.2 Fair and Ambitious </h3>
<p>DPR Korea’s GHG emission is 65714GgCO<sub>2</sub>e in 2000, which accounts for 0.16% of the World GHG emission in 2000 (40GtCO<sub>2</sub>e). With the GHG emission of 2.9tCO<sub>2</sub>e per capita in 2000, DPR Korea is one of low GHG emitting countries in terms of emissions per capita. GHG emission per capita will be increased to 6.5tCO<sub>2</sub>e in 2030, but it will be still below the world average.</p>
<p>Considering the significance of energy issues in ensuring the sustainable development, DPR Korea continue to give national development priority on the work to keep energy production ahead of economic development. But there are no domestic oil and natural gas resources in DPR Korea. Thus domestic coal accounts now for a comparatively large share of energy consumption in energy and industrial sector. This share has a tendency to increase with the activation of the national economy in the near future.</p>
<p>In order to make national contribution to mitigation of climate change fair and ambitious in this development context, DPR Korea attaches the mitigation priorities to the energy and industrial sector in where it is possible to pursue synergy with adaptation to climate change, and thus expects to decrease GHG emission per final energy use and GDP.</p>
<p>DPR Korea’s GDP per capita is 462US$ in 2000. This implies that capability of DPR Korea for mitigation measures with only domestic resource is not sufficient to contribute to responding the climate change, an issue on a global scale.</p>
<p>Especially, international support has a great potential to encourage mitigation measures in DPR Korea, because this INDC expects that conditional contribution takes about 80% of the national GHG emissions mitigation target in 2030.</p>
<h3 id="legal-and-policy-framework-to-support-the-implementation-of-national-ghg-mitigation-measures">2.3 Legal and Policy Framework to Support the Implementation of National GHG Mitigation Measures </h3>
<p>DPR Korea has strengthened national legal and policy framework for responding climate change in a way of integrating climate change into various laws and mid- or long-term strategies. Measures to achieve the GHG emissions mitigation target during 2021-2030 will be supported by the following relevant laws and policies in the fields of environment protection, energy and forest sector.</p>
<ul>
<li>Law on Environment Protection, Law on Environment Impact Assessment, Law on Air Pollution Protection</li>

<h3 id="monitoring-and-evaluation">2.5 Monitoring and Evaluation </h3>
<p>The monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the GHG mitigation component to achieve mitigation goals formulated in the INDC will be reflected in the National Communications and Biennial Updated Reports submitted to the UNFCCC.</p>
<h2 id="adaptation-component">3. Adaptation Component </h2>
<p>Annual mean temperature in DPR Korea rose by 1.9<sup>o</sup>C over the 20th century. It is over 3 times compared to the rate of global warming. In the late 21st century, annual mean temperature in DPR Korea is expected to rise by 2.8<sup>o</sup>C to 4.7<sup>o</sup>C compared to the average (8.2<sup>o</sup>C, 1971-2000).</p>
<p>Sea level in DPR Korea by 2100 is expected to rise by 0.67m to 0.89m compared to 2000. Thus coastlines in the East and the West Sea may retreat by 67m to 89m and 670m to 890m over 100 years, respectively.</p>
<p>In the late 21st century, water resources (surface water) in DPR Korea are expected to be almost the same as the average (1971-2000) or decrease by 7.9%. In the future, it is expected that severer flood than the present will appear during rainy season, severe drought that the present will appear in spring. In addition, loss in land resources and land degradation will be accelerated by increase of flood, landslide and draught events.</p>
<p>The general goal of adaptation strategy to climate change in DPR Korea is to recover degraded natural eco-environment, improve its function, establish economic, social and environmental structures coping with climate change, and raise up adaptation capacity to negative impacts of climate change into the advanced level.</p>
<p><strong>Especially, the basic direction of the strategy is </strong></p>
<p>Firstly, to establish the whole social spirit for adaptation to climate change through strengthening public awareness raising and technology transfer, and through supplementing and completing laws, regulations, institutions and management systems related to adaptation to climate change.</p>
<p>Secondly, to carry out adaptation measures to minimize negative impacts to climate change, reflecting them to the national strategy for development of science and technology, energy and agriculture, etc.</p>
<p>Thirdly, to ensure investment for the work to minimize loss of life and property, and build the national capacity for prevention of disastrous events through establishment of the national real time monitoring system, early warning system and enhancement of corresponding capacity of central and Government bodies to natural disasters such as flood, draught, forest fire, landslide, typhoon, and tidal wave, etc., caused by climate change.</p>
<p>Fourthly, to build research and development capacity related to adaptation to climate change and to train technicians and experts through various opportunities and processes such as university education, training and practice, etc., and to contribute to improvement of people’s living and sustainable development of the country through concentration on research, development and introduction of advanced adaptation technologies and methods.</p>
<p>Fifthly, to establish the system for efficient water resources management, scientific agricultural production and advanced medical care corresponding to negative impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>Sixthly, to encourage the work to effectively cope with negative impacts of climate change so as to draw all social members into, and to actively speed up bilateral and multi-lateral cooperation with international organizations and other countries. The measures in the following table are prioritized among adaptation measures for a purpose of successful implementation of the adaptation strategy.</p>

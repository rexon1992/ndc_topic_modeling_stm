<p>September 2015</p>
<h3 id="national-context">1. NATIONAL CONTEXT</h3>
<p>Burundi is a landlocked country at the heart of Africa’s Great Lakes Region, located between the meridians 29°00’-30°25 East and parallels 2°20°-4°25’ South. It has an area of 27,834 km² and belongs to two major river basins: the NileBasin, accounting for 13,800 km² of the country’s territory, and the CongoBasin, covering 14,034 km². Its mostly rural population, with an urbanization rate of around 10.4%, was estimated at 8,053,574 at the time of the 2008 census, with an average density of 310 inhabitants/km².</p>
<p>The Burundian economy is dominated by the primary sector, which accounts for nearly half of its gross domestic product (GDP) and close to 80% of its export income; the secondary sector (industry and handicraft) represents just 17-18% of GDP, and the tertiary sector, only about one third of GDP. The current production structure, dominated by subsistence farming, makes the economy very vulnerable and fragile due to its dependency on climate conditions.</p>
<p>Electrical power consumption in Burundi, amounting to 25 kWh/person/year, represents just 4% of the energy balance.</p>
<p>In Burundi, activities relating to climate change were marked in particular by the development and publication of the first and second national communications under the UNFCCC. At the same time, Burundi also prepared its National Adaptation Programme of Action to climate change (NAPA). The actions identified in the NAPA covered the key sectors of the Burundian economy. As various sectoral adaptation and vulnerability assessment studies have shown, climate change affects every sector of the country’s economy, particularly agriculture.</p>
<p>The prospects for sustainable ecological growth were defined through Burundi Vision 2025 and translated into a short term action plan as part of the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategic Framework covering the period of 2012-2015. In the medium to long term, the Government plans to engage in a transition toward a green economy. Burundi Vision 2025 makes a firm commitment to prioritizing the country’s protection and rational management of the environment such that Burundians can live in a protected, properly managed setting.</p>
<p>The Government has stated its<strong>vision</strong> of the fight against climate change as follows: &quot;<em><strong>A State that promotes development that is resilient to the harmful effects of climate change</strong></em>&quot;.</p>
<p>At the institutional level, the Ministry of Water, the Environment, Land Management and Urban Planning, with its departments and personalized institutionssuch asIGEBU and OBPE, handles matters relating to climate change. For the fulfilment of its mission, the Ministry enjoys the support of frameworks for dialogue such as the National Environment Commission, the Sectoral Group on Water, Sanitation and the Environment (GSEAE), the National Water Partnership (PNE-Bu), and the National Platform for Risk Prevention and Disaster Management.</p>
<p>In the framework of its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC), Burundi intends to reaffirm its determination to contribute to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to strengthen its resilience to climate change while continuing to meet its own development challenges.</p>
<h3 id="adaptation">2. ADAPTATION</h3>
<h4 id="climate-change-impacts-and-vulnerability">2.1. Climate change impacts and vulnerability</h4>
<p>Studies conducted for the initial national communication on climate change and the evolution of climate parameters in Burundi through 2050, based on the general circulation model, show that the average annual temperature will increase by 1°C to 3°C. Rainfall will rise by roughly 10%, and the precipitation regime will be disrupted such that there will only be two seasons remaining, each lasting six months: a rainy season from November to April, followed by a dry season.</p>
<p>These climate changes will engender a large number of risks associated with the following phenomena: (i) season creep; (ii) flooding of swamps and lowlands; (iii) land degradation and loss of soil fertility; (iv) shortage of groundwater resources; (v) extreme weather events (hail, violent showers, heavy winds, etc.); (vi) changes to the growing seasons of crops and forests; and (vii) unpredictable movements of pests.</p>
<p>According to an integrated analysis of Burundi’s vulnerability, conducted as part of the ACCES (Climate Change Adaptation for Soil and Water Resources Conservation) Project, it was found that the country’s “hotspots of vulnerability” are located in the north and northwest. The slope of the ridge (and not the ridge itself) leading to the Imbo Plain to the west, the topographical structures to the north and the central plateau are the regions most vulnerable to erosion. The main causes are the highly variable relief and the pronounced sensitivity of those regions to climate variability.</p>

<h4 id="emissions-compensation">3.4. Emissions compensation</h4>
<p>In terms of compensation for any loss of revenue or for the restriction of certain economic activities due to the implementation of the INDC programme, Burundi will rely on international greenhouse gas emissions compensation mechanisms and on current national legislation.</p>
<p>In terms of forestry in particular, the plan is to promote the development of ecosystem services.</p>
<h4 id="verificationcounting-methods">3.5. Verification/counting methods</h4>
<p>Concerning carbon counting and verification methods, Burundi will conform to the IPCC’s guidelines.</p>
<h4 id="ambitious-equitable-nature-of-the-planned-contribution">3.6. Ambitious, equitable nature of the planned contribution</h4>
<p>Limiting the rise in GHG emissions presents a major challenge for Burundi, in view of its national context. Economically, Burundi is ranked a least developed country (LDC), with per capita GDP ofUS $282 (in 2012).</p>
<p>Burundi also has significant structural vulnerability due in particular to the country’s landlocked status and its exposure to weather and natural hazards. According to United Nations statistics, Burundi’s economic vulnerability index is 56.81 compared with an average of 45.7 in 2012 across all of the least developed countries. Faced with these development challenges, Burundi’s contribution is an ambitious one, as it plans for a 3% reduction in its emissions by 2030 for the unconditional scenario, and by 20% by that same year for its conditional objective.</p>
<h3 id="contribution-implementation-methods">4. CONTRIBUTION IMPLEMENTATION METHODS</h3>
<h4 id="institutional-arrangements-for-implementation">4.1. Institutional arrangements for implementation</h4>
<p>The Government of Burundi will implement the INDC through the Ministry of the Environment, which is the government institution in charge of ensuring the implementation of international conventions relating to the environment. It will used its customized departments and institutions like IGEBU and the OBPE, which handle questions associated with climate change, but also frameworks for dialogue such as the National Environment Commission, the Sectoral Group on Water, Sanitation and the Environment (GSEAE), the National Water Partnership (PNE-Bu), and the National Platform for Risk Prevention and Disaster Management.</p>
<h4 id="capacity-building">4.2. Capacity-building</h4>
<p>Despite the non-negligible step already taken to create and build capacities, national experts are still insufficient and have not yet acquired significant proficiency in the tools and methodologies available to produce GHG emissions inventories, climate change vulnerability and adaptation studies, and GHG emissions mitigation studies, as well as solid proficiency in the procedures used to compile financing applications for the available funding mechanisms. As a result, capacity-building will be needed to offset the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Insufficient climate data due to outdated facilities;</li>
<li>Insufficient scientific personnel able to satisfactorily run programmes and research topics linked to climate change;</li>
<li>Difficulty training technical and scientific personnel on-site or abroad due to the non-existence of training institutions specializing in climate in Burundi and limited cooperation with the outside world;</li>
<li>Insufficient quality and quantity of domestic technical expertise.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="technology-transfer-needs">4.3. Technology transfer needs</h4>
<p>Burundi does not have the technical resources to do research and development in the field of climate change and has no national programme on the subject. As part of the INDC’s implementation, Burundi’s technology transfer actions will pertain to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Promoting research and development, adopting new technologies, and harnessing them for the national context;</li>
<li>Reinforcing the operations of certain organizations and institutions involved in climate change;</li>
<li>Skills training, education and international cooperation.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="consideration-of-gender-youth-and-vulnerable-groups">4.4. Consideration of gender, youth and vulnerable groups</h4>
<p>Gender, youth and vulnerable groups are concerns that have not always been taken into account in Burundi’s national and sectoral socioeconomic development plans. In its Vision 2025, the Government of Burundi considers these to be cross-cutting issues to be incorporated into all development programmes. The same will apply to implementation of the INDC.</p>
<h4 id="need-for-financial-support">4.5. Need for financial support</h4>
<p>As was underscored above, most of the climate change adaptation actions identified in previously developed national and sectoral action plans have not yet been implemented for want of the financial means to do so. The table below summarizes the financial needs for implementation of the INDC in the form of programmes.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION </h2>
<p>The Central African Republic is a landlocked African country with an area of around 623,000 km<sup>2</sup>. The terrain consists of a vast peneplain dominated by two mountain ranges at its eastern and western ends joined by a central spine that separates the two principal drainages, the Chari-Longue basin in the north and the Congo basin in the south.</p>
<p>The climate is hot and humid equatorial, characterised by two seasons: a dry season and a rainy season. The rainfall varies between 800 mm in the north and 1600 mm in the south and the average annual temperature varies between 15 °C in the south and 38 °C in the north. The future scenario indicates an increase in temperature on the order of 1.4 to 2.2°C, assuming low greenhouse gas emissions, and 1.8 to 2.7°C, assuming high greenhouse gas emissions. The forecasts regarding change in precipitation are less clear. Some forecasts predict a slight increase in annual precipitation, while others project irregular variations in precipitation. The extreme climate hazards, the probability of which could increase with climate change, are torrential rains followed by floods and droughts.</p>
<p>From south to north, the biological diversity is composed of five large phytogeographic zones, each with a specific fauna: the <em>Guinean forest zone</em> of dense humid forests; the <em>Sudano-Ubangian zone</em>, sheltering dense semi-humid, open and dry forests; the <em>Sudano-Guinean</em> and <em>Sudano-Sahelian zones</em>, composed of various types of savannahs; and the <em>Sahelian zone</em>, consisting of steppes.</p>
<p>The population of the Central African Republic is estimated at 5 million, with a demographic growth on the order of 2.5%/year. It is predominantly rural (62.1%), female (50.2%) and young (49.4% less than 18 years of age). The country is sparsely and unevenly populated. The average population density is 7.2 inhabitants per Km<sup>2</sup>. Decades of military and political crises have destroyed the nascent development and the last conflict of 2012-2013 spread insecurity throughout the population, destroyed the productive fabric and dismantled the administrative machinery.</p>
<p>The Central African Republic is among the poorest countries on the planet, with a human development index estimated at 0.341 in 2013. Poverty affects more than half the population, with the corollaries of food insecurity and a lack of basic social services. The Central African economy still relies on a primary agricultural sector with low value added and intensive use of poorly qualified and essentially rural manpower. To the various internal constraints to the country’s development, including the low level of industrialisation and the land-locked nature of the country, are added the ongoing changes in the climate, which are reflected in different impacts: slow and gradual changes in the environment, variation in the seasons and on occasions extreme climate events (floods, droughts, tropical storms etc.) that may result in natural disasters.</p>
<p>The annual emissions of the Central African Republic, estimated at 116,285.49 kt eq-CO<sub>2</sub> in 2010, or 26 tons eq-CO<sub>2</sub>/person, represent less than 0.002% of global emissions. Despite its low rate of GHG emissions, the Central African Republic reaffirms its adherence to the principle of collective but differentiated responsibility and, in accordance with Decision 1CP/19, is taking the present ambitious measures to respond to this challenge without impeding its economic, social and environmental development.</p>
<p>However, the vulnerability to changes in the climate and a lack of ability to adapt to their adverse impacts represent serious threats to the management of ecosystems and other agricultural and renewable natural resources, social cohesion, stability and sustainable development. Thus, the Central African Republic is obliged to take into account the adaptation of its land, its communities and its socioeconomic activities in this effort to contribute to the mitigation of climate change. The incorporation of an adaptation component in the INDC is thus a strategic choice that is vital to the country. Moreover, not only do most of the adaptation measures, particularly those that help deal with land use change and reduce the fundamentally non-remunerative nature of agriculture, also contribute to mitigation. However, the adaptation component, which concerns the poorest, most exposed and most vulnerable populations, is an occasion to promote throughout the national territory socioeconomic development on a fair and sustainable basis that can meet the challenges of improving access to the country and preventing inter-regional conflicts.</p>
<p>The Central African Republic’s vision is “t<em>o become an emerging country, built upon an economy that is diversified, sustainable and uniformly shared throughout the national territory, a modern state open to the world and committed to an ethic and to technological innovation.</em>” The general objectives of the Central African Republic’s INDC are focussed on sustainable, low-carbon development and growing resilience of the sectors of agriculture and food security, health, management of natural resources and infrastructure against the adverse effects of climate change.</p>
<p>The process of developing the INDC is based on a review of the literature, consultation of the stakeholders and the directives for evaluating greenhouse gas emissions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). At the institutional level, a Technical Group of Multi-Sectoral National Experts responsible for developing the INDC has been established.</p>
<h3 id="section-1.-mitigation-of-greenhouse-gas-emissions">Section 1. Mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions </h3>
<h4 id="general-objectives">General objectives </h4>
<p>The Central African Republic aspires to reduce its emissions by 5% and 25%, respectively, in the 2030 and 2050 horizons in comparison to its reference BaU emissions and to increase its sequestration potential. With international support, it will emit around 33,076.1 kt eq-CO<sub>2</sub> less in 2050 than the annual reference emissions.</p>
<p>The Central African Republic also aspires to reduce emissions of short-lived climate pollutants (SLCP), which science has shown have a significant short-term climate-warming potential and harmful effects on health, agriculture and ecosystems.</p>

<p><em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Inventory of greenhouse gases in 2010 (Ministry of Environment, Ecology and Sustainable Development, 2013) </em></p>
<p>Key (left to right): INDC emissions; INDC sequestration; Agriculture; Other energy; Wood energy; Waste; Industrial processes</p>
<p>The reference data show the inventory of greenhouse gases in 2010 as published in the Second Communication of the Central African Republic. Greenhouse gas emissions total 116,285.49 kt eqCO<sub>2</sub> with sectoral contributions of 89.46% for land use change and forestry; 5.26% for agriculture; 5.19% for energy (of which 4.91% is wood energy); 0.09% for waste and marginal amounts for industrial processes and use of solvents. In addition, the sequestration potential is evaluated at 330,000 kt eq-CO<sub>2,</sub>, 62% for land abandoned after use and 38% for biomass.</p>
<h4 id="reference-scenario">Reference scenario </h4>
<p>The assumptions of the reference scenario are based on:</p>
<ul>
<li>The success of the Emergency Programme for Sustainable Recovery (PURD), the principle objectives of which are return to constitutional order, consolidation of the peace and security, as well as restructuring of public finances and the primary sector.</li>
<li>The resumption of sustained economic growth for the diversification and intensification of economic activities, including increase of the energy supply and updating of the National Agricultural Investment and Food Security and Nutrition Programme (PNIASAN) and the National Industrialisation Programme.</li>
<li>Development of individual, institutional and systemic capacities.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2050, the Central African Republic will emit around 189,271.8 ± 94,635.4 kt eq-CO<sub>2</sub>, i.e. 62.7% more than in 2010, with sectoral contributions of 68.4% for land use change and forestry; 13.4% for energy (10.7% of which is for wood energy); 13.4% for agriculture; 3.2% for water; and finally 1.6% for industrial processes and use of solvents.</p>

<p>Key: Light blue: Industrial processes-use of solvents (IP-US); Purple: Waste; Olive: Energy; Oragne: Agriculture; Green: Land use change and forestry (LUCF)</p>
<p>Taking into consideration the net rate of deforestation, which is 0.155% (EDF 2013), the country’s potential for sequestration will be 310,146.43 ± 155,073.22<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> kt eq-CO<sub>2</sub> in 2050, while it was 330,000 kt eq-CO<sub>2</sub> in 2010, a reduction of 6.02%.</p>
<p>However, it should be noted that the Central African Republic’s climate forecasts, which show an increase in rainfall and insolation, are favourable for the appearance of forest re-growth throughout the country. This phenomenon will increase the sequestration capacity of the forests.</p>
<h4 id="greenhouse-gas-mitigation-measures">Greenhouse gas mitigation measures </h4>
<p>The national contributions consist of:<strong>: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unconditional measures</strong> within the ongoing national initiatives, namely the development of industrial forestry sites and the national reforestation initiated since 1980, the outreach programme to gradually abandon slash-and-burn agriculture and burning of agricultural waste and the promotion of low-energy light bulbs initiated by the national power company Energie Centrafricaine (ENERCA) within the framework of the energy conservation policy, and the promotion of improved cook stoves.</li>
<li><strong>Conditional measures</strong>, which will be implemented thanks to international support in the sectors of land use change and forestry (LUCF), energy, agriculture, industrial processes and waste (table 1).</li>

<p>The implementation of the unconditional mitigation measures will make it possible to reduce greenhouse gas emission by 4,062 kt eq-CO<sub>2</sub> and 10,410 kt eq-CO<sub>2</sub>, respectively, in 2030 and 2050. With the support of the international community, the Central African Republic will reduce 5,500 kt eq-CO<sub>2</sub> and 47,320 kt eq-CO<sub>2</sub>, respectively, in 2030 and 2050.</p>

<h3 id="section-2.-adaptation-to-the-adverse-effects-of-climate-change">Section 2. Adaptation to the adverse effects of climate change </h3>
<p>The Central African Republic is at the same time in a post-conflict situation and in political transition, which exposes it to a considerable level of socioeconomic vulnerability. Moreover, the entire national territory is exposed to extreme climate hazards represented by drought and torrential rains followed by floods. The torrential rains and floods affect principally the southern part of the country, while drought is more present in the north and northeast. The rural populations that are the poorest are the ones that are most exposed. Thus, climate changes affect 75% of the Central African population.</p>
<p>In this regard, the INDC, by enhancing resilience to climate change in the key sectors, an essential element of sustainable development, can contribute to national cohesion, stabilisation of the country, restoration of authority and of government actions. In addition, it will facilitate a programmatic approach to increasing the adaptation capabilities of communities, ecosystems and the activity sectors of agriculture, animal husbandry, forests, health and other sectors vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change.</p>
<h4 id="adaptation-options-and-objectives">Adaptation options and objectives </h4>
<p>Eight adaptation options have been identified from the 27 objectives derived from the national priorities. Five ongoing initiatives that enjoy the support of international development partners and 15 prospective adaptation measures are presented below as preconditions for developing a National Adaptation Plan that defines a group of measures to be taken at various decision-making levels (region, prefecture etc.).</p>

<h5 id="probability-of-co-benefits-of-adaptation-and-mitigation-measures">Probability of co-benefits of adaptation and mitigation measures </h5>
<p>We note that all the measures relating to the agriculture and forestry sector can generate mitigation co-benefits. For example, the objective of the National Programme for Investment in Agriculture, Food Security and Nutrition (PNIASAN) is to attain and maintain an annual agricultural GDP rate of 6% and a food insecurity rate of 15%. It envisages the mobilisation of 70% of the population to initially enhance 661,826 ha of land, with a planned expansion of 28.6%, reaching 851,750 ha in five years. The inclusion of climate-sensitive agroecological approaches (smart agriculture) in the PNIASAN with a view to increasing productivity and yield may make it possible to keep each farmer on the same original parcel of land for five years, which will make it possible to minimise or complete avoid increases in area and thus capitalise the deforestation (28%) avoided over the four years following the start-up of the project. To do this, it is necessary to revise the PNIASAN and consequently increase its budget through the contribution of the expected conditional funds, particularly from the Green Climate Fund.</p>
<h3 id="section-3.-implementation">Section 3. Implementation </h3>
<p>The Central African Republic envisages a holistic approach, integrating adjustment of national policies and strategies, improvement of the legislative and regulatory frameworks, and capacity development and transfer of technology in certain priority areas.</p>

<p>Technology transfer will include a capacity development programme to be adopted at various levels, both institutional and local.</p>
<h4 id="need-for-financing">Need for financing </h4>
<p>The needed financing totals US $3.802 billion over the commitment period, i.e. US $2.248 billion to implement the mitigation measures and US $1.554 billion for the development of resilience to climate change.</p>
<p>Underestimation of the cost of investments needed for adaptation may keep in place the development gap caused by climate hazards. The approach taken by the FUND model, which will be supported by the preparatory work of the National Adaptation Plan, estimates the country’s needs for adaptation to climate change at an average of around US $34,500,000 per year up to 2030 and an average of US $57,500,000 per year up to the year 2050.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Central African Republic, a non-Annex 1 country, supports the inclusion of international market instruments, such as the Clean Development Mechanism, in a post-2020 climate agreement. Such an instrument may be used to help finance certain investments in low-carbon infrastructure that is resilient to climate change.</p>
<p>The Central African Republic considers that certain low-carbon development options and supplementary actions could be entirely or partially financed by the international transfer of carbon assets, taking into consideration environmental integrity and transparency factors.</p>

<h4 id="obstacles-to-be-overcome">Obstacles to be overcome </h4>
<p>For the financial effort expected from the Central African Republic’s international partners to be fully effective, the funds must be effectively used. Moreover, the following difficulties also have to be surmounted:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Military and political crises: for the past several decades these have contributed to weakening of all of the country’s institutions, political instability, insecurity and extreme poverty.</strong> The ongoing programme to develop social cohesion and bring the country together should make it possible to stabilise the situation.</li>
<li><strong>The lack of synergy between sectoral policies and institutions: this leads to jurisdictional conflicts and underperformance and affects the efficiency of the government. It can delay the achievement of the INDC’s objectives.</strong> The ongoing improvement in inter-ministerial coordination should respond to this concern.</li>
<li><strong>The illiteracy rate (estimated at 67% in 2008): this limits access to information and to opportunities, the acquisition of skills and, as a consequence, the level of the citizen’s contribution to carrying out public policies and meeting the government’s international commitments.</strong> Educational programmes are ongoing and basic literacy should be improved.</li>
<li><strong>The absence of interregional socioeconomic equality leads to frustration and social tensions.</strong> The government will implement a decentralisation programme that will permit decentralised entities to play a full role.</li>
<li><strong>The government’s insufficient capacity for investment does not permit it to cover by itself the costs of implementing the INDC</strong>. The actions and support of the development partners and the improvement of the business climate are necessary to carry out the Central African Republic’s INDC.</li>
<li><strong>Poor ability to absorb funds and deal with the lenders’ procedures will affect the smooth implementation of the programmes.</strong> The enhancement of individual and institutional capabilities will improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the programmes.</li>
<li><strong>Extreme poverty: when joined to the other factors listed above, this has been a breeding ground for violence for several decades.</strong> The implementation of the antipoverty strategy is a specific priority for significantly reducing extreme poverty.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="monitoring-and-notification-of-progress">Monitoring and notification of progress </h4>
<p>The Central African Republic’s INDC is a development policy with low carbon emissions and low emissions of short-lived climate pollutants. In this regard, the Central African Republic will put in place an appropriate national measurement, notification and verification system. Moreover, the government will organise regular consultations with the stakeholders at the national, regional and local level to both update the actions and make sure that they are carried out.</p>

<p><strong>National Circumstances </strong></p>
<p>The global climate change is recognized as an unquestionable fact, and changes in the Earth climate system, observed from the 1950s, are unprecedented. A considerable warming of the atmosphere and ocean has occurred, world snow and ice storage has decreased, and average global sea level has increased. <em>The main reason for climate change</em> is the anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gases (GHGs) concentration in the Earth surface layer of atmosphere. The analysis of observation data collected under the World Meteorological Organization's Global Atmospheric Watch Program shows that the averaged carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases concentrations in atmosphere reaches their new maximum each year.</p>
<p>Uzbekistan is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change. Without additional resource saving measures, the country may face deficiency of water resources, growth in land desertification and degradation, increase in occurrence of droughts and other dangerous phenomena, leading to instability of agricultural production and threatening to the country’s food security. Since the early 1950s the average rates of air temperature growth throughout the territory of Uzbekistan were 0.29<sup>о</sup>С for each ten years, which is by 2 times higher than the global warming rates.</p>
<p>Besides, Uzbekistan has encountered the one of the most complicated problem for the Central Asia region – the Aral Sea ecological disaster. This is virtually one of the largest ecological disasters in the contemporary history. “The Aral Sea, once the unique and one of the most beautiful and largest inland water bodies in the world, has turned out to be at the edge of total disappearance during the life of one generation. This has caused unprecedented disaster and irreversible damage to the local population, ecosystem and biodiversity of the Priaralie”<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The climate change problem is of the global nature, since GHGs emissions are dispensed evenly in atmosphere and do not observe any boundaries. Therefore, only the international cooperation may help to stop increase in greenhouse gas emissions and eventually to decrease adverse impacts of climate change. Uzbekistan has signed and is successfully implementing its obligations under the UNFCCC. Uzbekistan also acclaims adoption of the new Global Climate Agreement.</p>
<p>Uzbekistan is the country with developing economy and the stable annual GDP growth rate of over 8%. The country’s population is more than 31 million people. According to the UN prediction, the country’s population will reach 37 million people by 2030.</p>
<p>In the long-term perspective, the structural reforms with focus on development of basic industry sectors, active investment policy for modernization and technological renewal of production, social, motor road and communication infrastructure will play the key role in speeding up paces of economic growth.</p>
<p><strong>Strengthening measures and actions aimed at climate change mitigation.</strong> Uzbekistan carries out the targeted policy for energy saving in the key economy sectors. <em>“Decreasing in GDP energy consumption by approximately 2 times as a result of broad introduction of the advanced energy saving technologies</em> <a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> has been identified in Uzbekistan as the one of targeted tasks for period up to 2030.</p>
<p>Strengthening the institutional capacity and improving the legal framework are carried out in renewable energy sector and energy efficiency to achieve the long-term sustainable development goals. The draft Long-term Strategy for low carbon development is considered in the country. It identifies target indices to energy efficiency and the “Program of measures for transition to low carbon development” for the key sectors of economy (electric energy, thermal energy, housing and utilities sectors), which are the main contributors to GHGs emission in Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>The measures for energy saving will allow decreasing consumption of primary energy, mainly natural gas. Investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy sources are of high priority from both economic (decrease in costs for energy generation) and climate viewpoint (decrease in volumes of greenhouse gas emissions).</p>
<p>The republic successfully carries out measures for adaptation to and mitigation of climate change impacts, including implementation of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Projects within the framework of the Kyoto Protocol. Over the entire period of the CDM project activities in Uzbekistan, it has been put into circulation 15,229,536 tons of Certified Emission Reductions in CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent (CERs)<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, and attracted foreign private investments in amount of USD 24.4 million.</p>
<p>The gradual modernization of the industry and a number of other measures implemented during the period from 1990 to 2010 have led to decrease in energy consumption of GDP by almost 2.5 times. Specific emissions of СО<sub>2</sub> per unit of GDP have been decreased by almost 50%.</p>
<p>Measures and actions aimed at energy resources saving have allowed Uzbekistan to stabilize level of greenhouse gas emissions and decrease its contribution to the world-wide emissions. According to the GHG inventory data, increase in the GHG emissions during the period from 1990 to 2010 was around 10% only.</p>
<p>During the period from 2007 to 2012, in accordance with the Decree of the Cabinet of Ministers<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>, 188 thousand units of vehicles were changed over to run on gas fuel.</p>
<p>Great attention is paid in the country to the development of renewable energy sources, especially solar energy. The production and experimental use of solar water heaters for hot water supply to residential houses and social facilities are carried out for more than 10 years. A large-scale project for construction of a number of photovoltaic power plants of 100MW each has been commenced. It is planned to bring up the share of solar energy in the total energy balance of the country to 6% by 2030.</p>
<p>Uzbekistan shares opinion of the world community regarding necessity to apply efforts to control the global climate change in accordance with the capabilities and responsibility of each country on a reasonable and equitable basis.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the decision of the 20th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change<sup>5</sup>, 1/СР.20, and in accordance with the national circumstances and sustainable development goals, taking into account transition of the country to a resource-efficient development model, the Republic of Uzbekistan has identified and presents its <strong>Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC)</strong> for the period up to 2030.</p>
